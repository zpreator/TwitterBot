This mrbeast cash giveaway is giving me that one red swimsuit giveaway back when I was in high school vibes. Just thought about how I’ll be 30 in 3 years and I just don’t think that adds up. I’m pretty sure I’m 23 still.. Who do I complain to about how my local Sinclair dinosaur is not regularly decorated for seasons and holidays. Not me laying in bed wanting my high school body back knowing all it would take is not eating Taco Bell twice a week and exercising 🥲. @EsplinJackson It’s time to give him the bird 🖕. Older generations struggle so much with new technology!!! 

It’s me, I’m older generations and have to ask Zach for help on everything. I will be destroying my lap top once I graduate next semester.. @koripaigers They had some amazing joggers a few weeks ago, ultra comf. @koripaigers C O S T C O. @_hayley_c I think we ate 2 a day for 3 days straight. Nothing else sounded good. 😂😂. @_hayley_c Lots of rest, stay very hydrated, severe cold medicine helped a buuunch, for headaches an ice pack or those freezer headband things, and McFlurries!!. @fake_laurarawra @APlayaNamedZach what is our date tonight?. @fake_laurarawra That’s a weird way to say ‘dead’. I’m so glad my dog can bark at the dishwasher to protect me ❤️. I want more plants. Went snowboarding yesterday for the first time in 3 years and I think I’m dead.. @EsplinJackson Ogres are like onions.. @fake_laurarawra Truth. @koripaigers I delivered you cookies and now you repay me by trying to come for my man?? wtf. @koripaigers Merry Christmas ❤️. I don’t know how y’all did full time school, worked and did life AND some of you even had kids all at the same time. 

I’m out here doing an online class or two a semester and barely surviving. 🥲. Things Loki now expects when he hears certain noises:

Ice Cubes
Shredded Cheese. Continued: “I did a Walmart pick up and I was SO MAD, they substituted my Diet Coke with Coke Zero.” 😤. Continued: “my hell it’s almost 9:00!!”. Continued: “can I give you a tip???? The best thing ever is taking a Xanax and then getting a deep tissue massage.”. Utah moms go wild in a local ice cream shop: “I felt like a little bit of a bad mom when I left my kids outside to go see magic mike”. @EsplinJackson @koripaigers Moral of the story is that you need to get Kori chipotle more. @EsplinJackson He can come to my homa any day 🏌️. @fake_laurarawra Love what you love, inspirational. My toxic trait is that I log into our retirement accounts daily to check their balances. What is wrong with me. 🙃. @GoldenFace328 Your team mates let you down 😤. HUSBANDS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO GO ON BUSINESS TRIPS IN THE WINTER. It has snowed 3 times and I am not okay.. There’s this beautiful woman that comes into work basically daily and she is gorgeous inside and out. I low-key fan girl over her. Today she came up to me and said I make HER day every time she sees me and basically we almost started crying together. 🥹🥺. Almost just texted someone about buttnut squash instead of butternut LOL. @koripaigers @EsplinJackson Not Taco Bell 💀. @fake_laurarawra Ah yes one pack a day weekend. @EsplinJackson He’s probably going to ask for feet pics 🙄. @_hayley_c Agreed, will you be my lawyer please. I thought I hated discussion boards, but this semester I have to take video responses??? wtf time to drop out. @EsplinJackson You don’t have rocket league side swipe on your phone??? Are you even a true gamer?. @koripaigers @EsplinJackson https://t.co/lQ3SmpZnkl. @koripaigers @EsplinJackson I think there are two “in n out” jokes that lie within this scenario. 😏. @EsplinJackson Chicken Nuggets?. Why on earth would anyone choose it’s complicated as a relationship status on Facebook?!. @koripaigers “In my 30s” when did we get old 💀. @ChipotleTweets Thanks Levi 🥲. @ChipotleTweets since today is National Laura eats chipotle day, do I get anything special?! I may even be your most loyal Chipotle lover named Laura tbh. @EsplinJackson @DNVR_Rockies Couldn’t have said it better myself 🟪⬜️⬛️. Most people on November 1st: DISCOUNT HALLOWEEN CANDY!!!!!
Me: https://t.co/hoFtU7eXEG. @EsplinJackson According to the internet, the most current result was for 2021 and it’s University of Miami. I will be filing a formal complaint for them to update their information for 2022 stats.. @EsplinJackson Sports make me angry too sometimes. I did not have Zach being more obsessed with our dog than I am on my bingo card this year. @fake_laurarawra No we are not wearing dinosaur earrings today.. After almost a year of having an iPhone I am now annoyed by the green Android messages. Am I part of the cult now?. @EsplinJackson An actual disgrace to the sport itself ugh. @koripaigers @EsplinJackson I guess the cheese balls are almost like tiny pumpkins if you squint. Things that scare Loki: sneezes, burping, coughing, hiccups, and door stops. I find it funny that I’ve been researching all listed ingredients on dog food and treats because I want the best for Loki boy, but I definitely do not do that for my own food 😂. @_hayley_c I think I can manage to spare a couple for a tradition ❤️ 🍊. @_hayley_c It was probably because I bought all of them 😂. I just remembered that Terrys Chocolate Oranges are a thing and I cannot wait to survive off them from November to January 🥰. @JohnHam66024645 @fake_laurarawra I personally relate to the omg kill me now. @fake_laurarawra This is simply not true 🙄. Not me crying while looking at dogs to adopt 🥺. @raisingcanes 100% replacing the coleslaw with another piece of toast. The Texas toast give me life. Well carbs give me life but same thing right??. @fake_laurarawra Relatable. @mmauser_3 Happy to provide you some amusement 😂😂. I would love for my neighbors to stop shooting off fireworks. You know who didn’t have fireworks? Pioneers. Celebrate Pioneer Day by churning butter or something idk. @EsplinJackson are you telling me that this is what the two ice cookie stick hitting teams are trying to win? https://t.co/VjVXJb3qrg. Taco Bell needs to keep nacho fries all the time. I get that it’s a marketing tactic, but they would still make just as much just from my purchases alone.. Overheard in Walmart parking lot:
Guy:*makes fun of girl in friend group*
Girl: Do you even KNOW how LONG I’ve avoided ELECTRONICS?
…
EVER. SINCE. MY. BANKRUPTCY.. Today I couldn’t remember the term super bowl, so I described it as the big football thing. 😂. @JohnHam66024645 @fake_laurarawra The market be cray. If I could turn into a chicken finger from cane’s, I would. @EsplinJackson I must’ve missed that game, my bad 🙏. @EsplinJackson You don’t have to sugarcoat it, he’s always been the worst. I’m ready for the rest of Stranger Things, right now. @HayleyBCousin Obviously this is not the biggest part of this issue, but she misspelled ‘banned’ which makes me care for her argument even less lol.. Overheard at airport bathroom 
Mom:*coughs*
Kid: I hope you aren’t sick forever
Mom: oh I won’t be!
Kid: yeah I don’t know about that 🤔. Got in from a red eye flight at 7am, took a 4 hour nap, got Taco Bell. I think I’m going to call it a day.. After sitting in traffic for 2 hours for what is normally a 40 min drive on I-15 this is very relatable. https://t.co/QWTvzeep26. @HayleyBCousin This is how I feel about most sports. 🫠. Why must people at movie theaters insist on screaming and clapping during every moment of a movie?? What does it accomplish other than cutting out portions of audio?. @fake_laurarawra The only time @JohnHam66024645 and @APlayaNamedZach didn’t have a bunch of dishes in their apartment sink. @EsplinJackson Same. @HayleyBCousin I don’t blame you. 😂😂😂. @HayleyBCousin You should check out my moms page. She basically uses click bait and posts the link in the comments so it “doesn’t get removed” lol but It’s scary how people will share anything without doing any research.. @fake_laurarawra This is false. @brittkahn28 @EsplinJackson @drpepper The proof will be a dark berry Dr Pepper in @EsplinJackson hands. @HayleyBCousin People be gross. 🤢 I too am against front loaders after watching too many cleaning videos. 😂 GOOD LUCK ♥️. @EsplinJackson @Rockies Everything probably will not be okay. @EsplinJackson Negotiating with anyone named Dick is truly hard. @EsplinJackson @drpepper I understand that you are distraught over @drpepper not bringing dark berry back, but the cleaning bottle in the background is concerning.. @APlayaNamedZach @fake_laurarawra Sometimes I hate hills more than loud eaters, iconic.. @fake_laurarawra I did not finish thank you cards ever and I never will. Thanks for reminding me Laura Bot 🥲. Last night I made garlic bread and I accidentally dropped one and it fell to the bottom of the oven onto the heating element and immediately caught on fire. I now know I don’t do well in stressful situations involving fire. 😂. @reno_lexi Hang in there ♥️ love you 💕. @HayleyBCousin Wow that’s wild!!!. @EsplinJackson 🐐 🐐 🐐. @HayleyBCousin This version is my favorite!! It’s so challenging!. @HayleyBCousin Sending all the good vibes to you. ♥️♥️🏡 it’s definitely a roller coaster of a process!. @reno_lexi LOVE THIS 🥺. I cannot taste toothpaste, but I can still taste Taco Bell, I count that as a win.. Definitely jinxed myself by saying “wow I cannot believe I haven’t had Covid yet!!” the other week. lol. @Lyssadeannee The fact that you are trying is all that matters ♥️. Covid tests do not have my permission to be so invasive in my nostrils ☹️. @EsplinJackson Probably at least one more time. @koripaigers @fake_laurarawra @APlayaNamedZach Can’t be confirmed or denied 🤷‍♀️. We don’t have kids but our house came with these cement tattoos and I feel it’s now our duty to buy paw patrol products whenever we get the chance https://t.co/80dm0Jscvt. Paw patrol Mac n cheese is superior. @svnflower_groot Hang in there ♥️♥️ love you!!. @fake_laurarawra Tbh your ability to tell a story is a train wreck. Idk who let me do my eyebrows so dark in high school but I think I am entitled to compensation. @APlayaNamedZach @fake_laurarawra Idk if Laura bot is referring to you tho. @fake_laurarawra You dawg. @HayleyBCousin What a nice family bonding activity 😂. @fake_laurarawra Okay Laura Bot, you need to get it together and stop retweeting my ex, this is a little pathetic especially since it’s been THE SAME TWEET 3x.. @EsplinJackson @koripaigers A very reasonable 11 times?? WEAK.. Me, tired of painting, also insane: I think we should refinish the kitchen cabinets and paint them white. @fake_laurarawra @APlayaNamedZach is this how I flirted with you?. Casual things to see on my drive home ya know https://t.co/JmlNoFyLRc. @EsplinJackson 😭. @EsplinJackson @drpepper If they don’t bring it back I will sue.. @EsplinJackson Good things always come to an end 🥲. I went in only wanting to paint the 3 bedrooms, I have already done far more than that, but basically I want to repaint every inch in the whole house because I’m insane.. @fake_laurarawra This is false, I always hate myself for work. @reno_lexi I die every time. Got my monthly workout in thanks to the walk to and from gate B at the SLC airport!. @EsplinJackson The bobble head agrees. @EsplinJackson I keep asking myself the same question 🤬. @EsplinJackson You’re so right. Why is it that I can bake the most complicated desserts, but I cannot make decent rice. Why is it so hard?. Actual quote from a kid in Target: MOM I want to be a squid for Christmas. 🐙. @HayleyBCousin LOL I have a pile of those on the dresser. 😂 I will support your efforts!! Tell me where to sign!. I feel like minimal Halloween decorations are the best. Like yes please just place a single skull on a stake and put it in your yard. I'm all for going all out too but man just one skull in your yard makes me lol. @JohnHam66024645 Just realized that with the leaf in the table does fit 10. lmao. Tonight we went to Chili's and I literally ordered chili just to say that I did. What is wrong with me. 😂 

Welcome to Chili's. Baja blast is healing.. @kassadywright You are enough. ❤️ You're an amazing mother and wife. An amazing coach. And so much more. Don't compare yourself to anyone else, doing your best is the best for you. 💕. I think a lot about a convo I had with my mom a few months ago that went like this

Her: so there's a big lake by you guys right?
Me: you mean the Great Salt Lake??
Her: no not that one
Me: well that's literally the only one
Her: yeah idk
Me: 🤨🤔. @fake_laurarawra LAURA BOT PLEASE STOP RETWEETING MY EX. @HayleyBCousin We are behind like 4 episodes and I feel like I just need to binge it 😅. @fake_laurarawra Relatable. Is it appropriate to message a girl I sold something to on FB marketplace and ask if she wants to be my friend 🥲. What do I prioritize... Very very excited to get our house sprayed for spiders next week 😬 Y I K E S. @fake_laurarawra You're right, I do deserve to be able to eat Texas roadhouse rolls whenever I want.. @HayleyBCousin The webs are okay, the spiders are not 😂 I understand they are a package deal but I said what I said. 😂. Zach: the house has lots of spider webs
Me: perfect, they will make great Halloween decorations 🕷️ 🕸️. On the list of things I did not think I would do today: run outside work across the parking lot at sonic speed, flailing my arms around to get the attention of the dump truck driver to tell him to move our garbage can lol. @APlayaNamedZach @fake_laurarawra I think today's tweet and this tweet go together 😂. I keep having to remind myself that I absolutely do not need a dining table that seats 8 for any reason at this point in life 😂. We close on our house tomorrow and have packed absolutely nothing which is fine because we have till the end of Oct get out of our apartment but I definitely feel like I shouldn't be as calm as I am right now LOL. @EsplinJackson @drpepper PLEASE @drpepper bring back Dark Berry. I can't stand to see a friend this distraught that you guys keep ignoring him.. I am still shocked that we went from thinking of buying a house to being under contract in less than 2 weeks time. 😂. So this kid at our complex just tried to follow me into our apartment and I was just like this isn't your house?!?!

Can't wait to move out 😂. @fake_laurarawra What a trip. We get to see our house again tomorrow and I'm so excited 🥲. @EsplinJackson Didn't even send the ones I finished I was so ashamed of it being that long. 😂. @EsplinJackson Nope. My present to myself for our 3 year anniversary was to give up and not worry about finishing them anymore. 😂. @EsplinJackson @drpepper bring back dark berry so Jackson can be happy again.. Me @ TBell this morning talking to the employee because it's been the same guy my last 38 visits so he must recognize me @ this point:

Him: we we ordered an extra 5 cases of Baja blast
Me: don't worry I will drink it
Him: was that you calling yesterday asking if we had any? 💀💀. @HayleyBCousin Me looking at my sweaters every morning https://t.co/FOLdM7pIqq. @fake_laurarawra @APlayaNamedZach I want a dog. @fake_laurarawra You basic. Why yes I did rewatch all of Friends in a very short time frame to throw the most epic Friends themed bachelorette party 😂. @fake_laurarawra @APlayaNamedZach even food is getting engineering degrees, step up your game. Me at 10:30pm: wow what a great time to reorganize my bathrooms and invent a new way to fold hand towels 🤪. I think I just committed to making 400 macarons. How are you?. @hbrewer333 Same here, I took that personally. @EsplinJackson @fake_laurarawra Agreed 😂. Also just want to take a second and say how much the SLC airport remodel sucks. I just wanted some Wendy's breakfast but the only restaurants they have are hipster bistros. Like what?? Give me some potato wedges please.. So I'm at the airport &amp; the gate I'm at was calling for final boarding &amp; paging a couple over the intercom. They were just closing the doors &amp; the couple nonchalantly walks up like it was fine??? The gate attendants were LIVID because they had checked their bags over an hour ago.. @EsplinJackson Yes. @HayleyBCousin I am also a youth SS teacher but our ward just be in a weird bubble. The YM are the only ones to participate with comments and the YW openly stated they didn't do any of the reading the last 3 weeks. 😂. @fake_laurarawra Jeeze Laura Bot. 😂. So a kid was outside our apt yelling "MOM" repeatedly and I audibly heard the mom sigh and then stomp over annoyed that she couldn't sit for 4 minutes in peace. I'm not even a parent yet and I relate. 😂. So if I retweet a tweet from the bot Zach made based on my tweets am I really just retweeting myself?. Thanks Zillow for notifying me when a house I saved is pending a sale after 3 days on the market.

We aren't even ready to buy yet but it still hurts. 😂. @HayleyBCousin @editor_caro The 'giving birth' to flour thing has me 😶. My toxic trait is buying groceries to make lunches to take to work but eating out instead.. @loudmouthwitch Which one do you have?! I tried it a few years ago and felt it left my mouth super dry. 😂 Maybe it's time to give it another go.. Zach and I are watching each Star Wars movie and then playing the lego Star Wars levels associated with it and its been my fave. @HayleyBCousin I'm preparing a shot of nyquil right now 😂. I am back to report that I am absolutely wrecked https://t.co/r9Oz1eTd6P. I am back to report that I am absolutely wrecked https://t.co/r9Oz1eTd6P. Praying that the second dose doesn't wreck me :'). I think the biggest shock of adulthood is becoming aware of all the things I've been doing wrong my whole life: making tacos, effective laundry, washing my hair properly, or knowing you're supposed to clean your dishwasher. 

The small things really. 😂. She ever so slightly tapped the corner of the bumper, it was so miniscule and just scraped the bumper, but she didn't even stop she just kept going 😂😂😂

I hate driving in Utah you guys 😂. Our apt is right off a busy street and turning into it is terrifying because it would be so easy to get rear ended. Today a lady was following real close and I was like "today is the day, she's going to hit me". @Cienna_Ruth We'll see how much longer I last. 🤣 I love the support though!!. @svnflower_groot Same!!! 🥲. Zach and I are trying to not eat out and limiting caffeine for a month and we are 5 days in.

Driving by any food place is so torturing. I want it all. 🥲. If they put a @Raising_Canes in the Ogden area I would 100% be content with living in Utah the rest of my life tbh. That's really all it would take.. @svnflower_groot Where are you registered love?? 💜🤍💜. @TMobile @Tesla I am limiting the amount of food waste and using reusable grocery, produce bags and silicone ziploc bags! Sure does feel good! Would love to have a tesla to help the environment even more!

#TMobileTuesdays #contest. Zach: "I don't understand why the spice cabinet is organized alphabetically and you have an organized cheese drawer in the fridge but you don't put clothes away"

Truuuuuuue. I honestly would love to make myself cute little lunches where everything is in its own little section in the meal prep box but WHO IN THE HECK HAS TIME FOR THAT?!?. @mmauser_3 It really made me cringe typing that out. Yikes.. Why do I feel so threatened by groups of high schoolers while shopping?!? I'm literally in my mid twenties.. @HayleyBCousin I'd have to ask, but I'm pretty sure there's a warranty period of sorts! Just another option to look into though 😊. @HayleyBCousin Our friends got a car from carvana and raged about how good the experience was, no underlying fees so you pay what you see online!. @HayleyBCousin Had a family member ask us to give them just one good reason why we got vaccinated and when we told them our reasoning they still told us it was stupid and we should not have gotten it. 🙃. *in line for Pirates of the Caribbean*
Some dad with a thick Boston accent to his crying daughter: "if you don't ride this ride it'll be the biggest regret of your life"

#justdisneythingsa. Will I make it through 2 more days of work without losing my mind before we go to Disney?. Me: I think I'll unpack the last few boxes today!
My head: how about a migraine instead?. @josieatk Okay that is the cuuuutest thing ever I'm obsessed! 🥺. I just ate the best Chipotle in my entire life 🤤. @Cienna_Ruth Most situations just make me laugh but man that caught me off guard. 😂. @Cienna_Ruth I got yelled at by a customer in line for going over the details of exchange rates for sending money to another country with the customer I was helping?? Like that's my job??. When did I become O L D. Zach made a twitter bot and trained it on my account and the first thing it talked about was chipotle. 

Very on brand for me. 😂. Why are dogs in cones so cute but sad at the same time?!?. We went to the store tonight and we are going to make that viral feta cheese dish and literally we got the L A S T package. First everyone was making banana bread during the pandemic now this. 😂. Why do kids think they have to scream at each other to communicate?! 

Y'all I'm trying to take a test in peace in my own home. 😂. I think a lot about this one time when I worked at Home Depot I announced over the intercom COLE TO THE SLAW instead of COLE TO THE SAW.. Our neighbors have gotten to be so loud that we may purchase a house a lot sooner than planned. 😂. @Lyssadeannee Dang it!! 🙁 That pisses me off. 🙄. @Lyssadeannee I don't know how true this is, but I've heard you can take the bill back to the hospital and tell them to remove it!. Our upstairs neighbor has a HORRIBLE cough and I'm ready to go buy her some cough syrup and leave it on her door. 😬😷. Update: no one will ever see me again, beat saber is addicting, also considering cancelling my gym membership bc this is a workout. Zach got an oculus, so basically I'm never going to see him again. @svnflower_groot Love you though ❤️ and I'm sorry that people don't know how to mind their own business.. @svnflower_groot Also I'm sick of people asking me when we are having kids. People have no idea what I'm going through, makes me want to cry sometimes. (All the time). @HayleyBCousin I also said wrap them!!! Although she might not fully remember this day, you will, and it is so fun to watch kids open presents!. @svnflower_groot Idk Taylor that's a pretty valid melt down in my opinion 😂. @svnflower_groot YOU ARE THE CUTEST. @houseandhens My mom and I did this when I was a kid (actually still do) with some McDonald's toy pokemon Squirtle. I most recently hid it inside a mug two years ago and it's literally a mug in the front and SHE. HASN'T. FOUND. IT.. Me: idk what a duvet is, but I want one
Me literally inside the duvet cover trying to get the comforter in: is this worth it? 🤨🙃. I pet 4 different dogs today, a new record for the year 🐶🐕🐶🐕. @svnflower_groot I'm going to have to bring an entire suitcase full of stuff at this point 😂. Y'all I really made it in life, I have my own desk at work 😂. @hbrewer333 This KILLED me. 😂😂😂. Zach and I sold our souls, but we bought new furniture for our apartment and it will arrive in 7 pieces over the next 4 months. 😂. In the middle of all the chaos of packing our moving truck, I got a call that I got the job!!! https://t.co/iclj2JDnvL. @maegannoelle @houseandhens I low-key could not burp for the longest time and I swear once I got married I could. Obviously not related but it's just the timeframe I remember it changing. 😂. @HayleyBCousin I call Gangsta Granny Gritter 😂😂. I hate that the things you use to clean things get dirty

Like get it together dishwasher, shower and washing machine 🙄. Interviewed for a management position in UT this morning, give me all the good luck dust you have! 🤞. @HayleyBCousin Was it your yearly starbuck hot chocolate? 😂. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/F6WY8h7gmR. Today I was taking to a customer and he asked when I move so I looked at a calendar and ITS TWO WEEKS AWAY I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO LOLOLOL. @HayleyBCousin My old manager helps with saving horses from slaughter houses. It's actually really cool, they bring them back to health and train them and then people can adopt them, it's a great program. 😊

https://t.co/D9c2riIvZE. It's about time that there's a national day for this. https://t.co/JtAG6aSatg. @jobenmck I agree with your update and appreciate the awareness you're spreading. 😊 Change needs to happen.. @jobenmck I hear you, but I do know the church has to go through a very extensive approval process when they post pictures of Christ. We obviously don't have the exact answer as to why but they could have altered the picture for a multitude of reasons.. Corporate just announced that they are no longer requiring employees to quarantine for 14 days after travel. I'm 3 days into my quarantine. Do I go back??? 😂. I always feel guilty eating or drinking anything after I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist. 🤣. The apartment we picked is 4 minutes away from Chipotle, now that's what I call an UPGRADE. @HayleyBCousin My mom opened the floodgates 😂. @Maddi_Baylee_ Also guac grilled cheese is great you literally just put some guac between the cheese layers and it's HEAVEN. @HayleyBCousin I apologize on behalf of my mother. 😂🤦‍♀️. @HayleyBCousin THIS GIF IS MY FAVORITE RESPONSE TO DUMB QUESTIONS. @HayleyBCousin The ghosts haunted your phone 😳 spoooooky. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/WZVOY6oIL7. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/hOzGS4zoBU. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/TjawUNQ4oB. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/ezKXrMn8dV. @svnflower_groot I love this energy! ❤️❤️ Choose to see the good! ❤️. @svnflower_groot The next time we will be home will be around Christmas! 🎄🎅. @svnflower_groot Honestly though 😂 I miss you. Why does finding a place to live have to be so stressful????. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/fgUGOzGHdG. @maegannoelle You could just keep it strapped to the top of your car year round. 😂. I have been looking at bedding non stop on Pinterest for inspiration for when we move and basically I learned that I knew nothing about making beds. 😂. I keep thinking about how we will probably get a dog in the next year. 🥺. @mmauser_3 There's a place in town that got the recipes for the shakes and they serve them now!!!!!! 🙏 It's called Righteous Slice!. I just remembered that I got sick with a bad cold on our honeymoon and I think I deserve a second honeymoon because of that.. @loudmouthwitch Bees are so cute!! I love the bumblebees with big fuzzy butts!!. @maegannoelle I thought I saw an article that the fire didn't get the area?? ☹️☹️. @bsimmonsjr Last one, is the commute time worth the difference in pay?. @bsimmonsjr Which gives you more opportunity to grow in the future?. @HayleyBCousin This is honestly the most 2020 thing in 2020. Me: wow I want to buy more candles
Also me: already has 12 candles. I am always shocked and worried by how many people don't know how loans and interest work, if you don't I am happy to chat and explain. 😊. @svnflower_groot I love you and admire your strength. ❤️ I am always here for you. ❤️. @ImaRapperDog This happened to me a few years back after I lost someone very close, I like to think that its a sign that they are watching over you cheering you on. Let me know if you ever want to talk! ❤️. Me when I know that a lot of my coworkers don't wash their reusable masks. https://t.co/vbz8YfMhZ4. @TMobile @Tesla I would take my Tesla to literally any beach! Haven't been to the beach in over 4 years!! #TMobileTuesdays #Contest. @TillamookDairy Honestly, it's the best flavor of Tillamook!!. @houseandhens It must be a side effect of eye twitching 🤷‍♀️😂. If you thought going to the DMV was the worst, just wait til you work at a bank during the pandemic &amp; each state has different extensions for expired IDs &amp; you have to navigate poorly designed websites only to find vague info. Literally a whole new level of disrespect for the DMV. @_radvlad_ @greyleigh_ I've been googling to try and figure it out and it doesn't get autocorrected or anything, so maybe it is correct! My bad! 🤷‍♀️. @_radvlad_ @greyleigh_ I might be wrong, but I believe an apostrophe can only be used when it's a contraction or insinuating ownership of the following word. The way it reads is the wife owns hot because wife's is not a contraction.. @APlayaNamedZach 🙄. @_radvlad_ @greyleigh_ Your wife is hot is correct, the sign actually said 'your wife's Hot' which is not correct. 😂 You can't see well with the addition made. 😊. @greyleigh_ I always notice the sign too, and how the grammar was wrong. 😂😂 This business really said 'Your Wife's Hot' 

Glad it's destroyed forever.. I freakin' love Halloween. @TaylorMamuzich I am so sorry that you have to go through this every day. ❤️. My violin student today: "today I saw a dog and I was like HAVE TO PET!!"

same girl, same. I pick up the kids from their camp today and I am so excited to tell them tonight before they brush their teeth to try and get their spit in the sink this time instead of on the floor and all over the cabinets. 💁🏼‍♀️

I'm going to make a great mom someday 😂. @maegannoelle Pretty sure my mom told me I would turn into a stripper if I wore a thong. 😂. @martin_yoselin I have the same issue tbh, everything I think to buy of he already owns. I recently have started doing things for him or creating experiences/memories. I helped clean the storage room while I was home and he really appreciated it!. We have three 15 yo boys staying with us for a couple days 

Zach just left for his internship in Utah

I quite literally became a single mom overnight you guys. @makenzieg22 Seriously though!!!!!!! People are whack.. @makenzieg22 There has no joke been a mobile FBI bus right next to my work for the last 4 months, it's been wild. The whole town was really hoping the kids would be alive still, it's really sad that it's come to this. ☹️ End/. @makenzieg22 Another interesting tid bit, in the cult, if your spouse didn't also believe, it was recommended that you take a large life insurance policy out on them. Ironically many of the cult members spouses have also died. 👀 7/. @makenzieg22 In the cult Chad believed that only the most enlightened people would move into the next life, and there was a limited number of people. There was an article somewhere that he judged the kids and if I remember correctly they were considered to be dark souls. 6/. @makenzieg22 Lori has been trying to lower bail ever since then, but the judges haven't budged. Fast forward to 2 days ago, they showed up at Chad's house outside of Rexburg and he was arrested and they found the human remains that are believed to be the missing kids. 5/. @makenzieg22 Lori and Chad had left the town and were found in Hawaii like nothing was wrong in late January or February. Lori was served with an order to produce the kids in Rexburg, she no showed and a few weeks later she was taken into custody and put in jail on a bail of a million $ 4/. @makenzieg22 There was an article and Lori had been looking for wedding rings and dresses on Amazon BEFORE Chad's previous wife even died. The kids were last seen in September by other family. But the kids grandparents asked for a welfare check in November and the kids weren't there. 3/. @makenzieg22 As a background, Lori's last 3? husbands all died and her last husband was shot by her brother in July and then her brother mysteriously died in December. Lori had 2 kids and she moved up with them to Idaho in August I think. 2/. @makenzieg22 This actually happened in the town I live in! So Chad and Lori were both involved in a cult which is how they met. Chad's previous wife died out of nowhere of 'natural causes' in October I believe, and 2 weeks later he was remarried to Lori. 1/. If you haven't been able to find butter at the store in the last 3 months, it was my mom's fault.. That's 164 sticks of butter. 164 STICKS OF BUTTER.. About a year later I decided to count the butter again... 

41 pounds of butter. I don't understand. 😂 https://t.co/SU7UGXgDFU. My 4.5 year old niece wanted to show me a book that used to be mine when I was her age, apparently I colored all over it in crayon and today she was like "Aunt Laura, you are supposed to color on paper not books."

She really told me how it is. 😂. @Lindsay_Renee31 ❤️. @HayleyBCousin Big ooof. But we need to stand up for what's right, so kudos to you. ❤️. @josieatk Dodged a bullet there https://t.co/opxF3SMiIN. @greyleigh_ She also just changed her name on Facebook and changed her privacy settings. 😂. Today I made 3 different types of fudge. 😊. @yenmaster87 I did that once and got home and realized that my house key was on the same chain as the car key... That was at the shop. 😂. @r_cxll Thank you!! ❤️❤️. @WhapGoblin This makes sense to me!! Thank you for an explanation!! 🙏. "Um hi, yes I would like to cash a check for my husband's brother's friend, no they aren't on my account and no they aren't here with me." https://t.co/aU7V712GIx. @deedledeeee I mean technically after I eat it will be considered a burrito baby 🌯. I'm here to update that in a little over 2 weeks I will be able to enjoy Chipotle once again. ❤️. @jordanforsyth7 ME EITHER. I've been trying to understand it for 2 years now with no luck. 😂. Can anyone explain the biker shorts trend to me??

That's what I wore when I was like 6, was I ahead of the fashion trend curve?. My flower seeds I planted are starting to sprout!!! I am so excited 🥰. @kyla_vo One time in 4th grade I got sick and literally left a trail all the way to the nurses office. Basically it's the most traumatizing memory I have. 😷. @Lyssadeannee You should apply to banks and credit unions!! After I was done working at retail stores that's where I looked and it has been great! 😊. Since no one else has said it, why does Wendy's give you so many bags??? They literally have a 1 item to 1 bag ratio when all my food could fit in one bag?? I just?. @greyleigh_ This whole story is like whaaaaaat. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/Fkpaek7jM8. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/6lXlLTy4gT. So I'm making pesto chicken in the Crock-Pot and baking a chocolate cake for Zach's birthday, the aromas in our apartment are... odd. They don't go together. 😂. Sorry if you got tagged in something from me, some people have too much time on their hands. 🤷‍♀️. @TaylorMamuzich HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL ❤️ https://t.co/zP3jLC2boi. @HayleyBCousin @BYULaw Way to go Hayley!!! ❤️👩🏼‍🎓🎉. I am here to report that I preheated my dutch oven and it did not crack and I am r e l i e v e d 

that thing was expensive 😂. I've been heavily researching making bread in Dutch ovens for the last week. There's been differing instructions on if you should preheat the dutch oven while it's empty. The manual says no because it will crack the porcelain, but ALL and I mean ALL the recipes say to preheat it.. @TaylorMamuzich I am proud of YOU!! You are doing an amazing job raising your daughter. Your last name is Groot, the cutest marvel character, what a flex on us all. And you're in the medical field??? WAY TO BE. ❤️❤️. I low-key love seeing how people from high school have changed and how they are being successful in their own individual ways, we may not have talked a lot or even now but I see y'all and support you and love it.. @kirsylou I saw that too! I think if that did happen we would look into moving back to Colorado this summer which doesn't seem too bad to me. 🤷‍♀️. @HayleyBCousin I am so proud of you. ❤️. Me: sits around on couch all day
Me at 10pm: time to clean everything. Some friends of ours announced a pregnancy yesterday and that they were due in December, meaning that she was 4-6 weeks along, which it's crazy early to publicly announce that!!! 

Today they said it was an April fool's joke and honestly that's such a poor taste in humor.. I don't know why, but I keep getting all these Chipotle ads saying they will deliver for free. 

They need to quit playing with my emotions because I know they won't deliver 3 hours away. 😥. @HayleyBCousin I hear ya!! It's annoying to have your phone going off constantly!!. @HayleyBCousin In Zach's family group chat we just send memes and it's great! Zach's youngest brother (13) doesn't understand most of them so he will respond '??' and then someone explains the meme to him. 🤣. @kirsylou We have been cleaning the drive thru tubes between every customer and this one girl verbatim "oh I'm not that worried!" YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. People irritate me so much. Stay inside!!!. @kyla_vo Today we paid our car off!!! A whole year early too! 😊. @yenmaster87 @GabriellaAlonz3 These ones are the BOMB, they are straight fruit snack quality. Be careful though because you'll want to eat the entire bottle. 😂 https://t.co/2oxw890Zup. Zach was doing his zoom class meeting and I was chilling on the couch and our Google home out of no where said

"Dare me to make you a sandwich."

😂😂😂. My neighbor recently got an English Mastiff puppy and he's SO CUTE.. me: i'm going to start eating better and try to not eat out this week
CostaVida: buy one entree and two drinks and get a free entree!!!
me: wow I just can't pass that up. Mind you I picked apart what they did write and gave them advice on how to incorporate analysis in there. I just cannot handle this!!! It's literally an intro class.. My teacher gave me a low score for peer reviews because I didn't comment on the 'criteria'. The paper I edited was not completed, they literally wrote 130 words and they didn't even get into any analysis. Excuse me, but how was I supposed to comment on what didn't exist????. @HayleyBCousin I was at the post office waiting in line and two ladies were there that knew each other and one said "oh hey tell me more about your business thing!!" And the other started talking about her MLM and I was like GIRL RUN NOW WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE. @HayleyBCousin This is exactly what I needed to see to cheer me up today. 😂😂. If anyone wants to read my essay and tell me how I am apparently not showing two different sides PLEASE BE MY GUEST.. I want to SCREAM I was one of the ONLY students who actually submitted a decent essay that met the word count and my teacher has the audacity to tell me that my essay isn't arguing anything when it is???????? I'm ready to accept a D in the class.. @HayleyBCousin And bra size too!!!. After today I should only have ONE place left to change my name!!!. I aspire to be this extra when I'm a parent https://t.co/lUHuaPuh3A. I am now at 993/1200, will I make it?? Probably not. 😂. I've got 606/1200 now and I have no idea how I will pull this together. 😂. I have 76/1200 words written for my essay that's due tomorrow, I say we call it a day! https://t.co/cwRZH52uW0. @enlchicago That is a really good point, thank you!. @kyla_vo That wouldn't surprise me at all. 🙄 I saw an article, not sure how true it was, but it said the virus leaked from a lab in China.... I am no expert and this is just based off of news articles reporting cases, but influenza has a death rate of around .14% and the Coronavirus has a death rate of roughly 3% currently, meaning that the Coronavirus has a death rate 21 times of influenza. (Correct me if wrong). I am no expert and this is just based off of news articles reporting cases, but influenza has a death rate of around .14% and the Coronavirus has a death rate of roughly 3% currently, meaning that the Coronavirus has a death rate 21 times of influenza. (Correct me if wrong). My coworker who doesn't vaccinate their kids thinks that the Coronavirus isn't a big deal and is just another strain of the flu 🙃. @HayleyBCousin What a talent. @HayleyBCousin YES!! Honestly I felt the same about homecoming and prom "is someone going to ask me? No? Okay. Let's just ruin my self esteem over here.". @taylor_rogers13 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/CI02YWglD4. @maegannoelle Meat gelato reminds me of this. 😂 I cannot get this out of my brain. 😂😭 https://t.co/4mrrEKDRj8. @maegannoelle This has me dead. 😂. @taylor_rogers13 Well, are you?. @cdr1317 Same here!! Luckily I rigged the system and have 3 day weekends the next 3 weeks. 😂 I am so dead.. @kyla_vo If you ever are in a slump and need someone to hype you up, just let me know ❤️. @kyla_vo You are NOT ugly. I love seeing pictures you post because your smile radiates so much energy!! ❤️ Also there's definitely some hot man out there for you just trying to get his priorities straight. You'll meet him when you least expect it. 😊. In Idaho this pay would support a family with one, maybe two kids and still allow for loan payments and the ability to put money in savings. 😂 https://t.co/ck31VzchSB. I finished everything I had on my to do list for the weekend, that never happens. 🤷‍♀️. @isabelzawtun When I worked at Home Depot a customer requested me to put their gallon paint can in a plastic bag, mind you the paint can had a fully functioning handle... They made it 5 feet and the bag broke and the paint spilled everywhere.. @TillamookDairy is the real MVP, thanks for the coupons!! They seriously are one of the my favorite dairy product brands!!. Part of me is terrified that I don't know where we will live this time next year when Zach graduates

The other part of my is psyched thinking about how I could live in TX, AZ, CA, CO maybe even somewhere on the east coast?!. @HayleyBCousin I can't get over her little nose 😭 and look at all that hair!!!. I am ALMOST done changing my name everywhere. 😂 Marriage is a lot of work!. How do people wake up in the morning and actually make breakfast??? I get up with barely enough time to get ready for work. 😂. @tacotoy There were some other reasons too, I'll text you!. I signed up for a class on Thursday nights where I go on campus. I did all my reading for the first class today, I started getting ready to leave and while putting my shoes on, I paused and decided to drop the class. 😂 

I'll try again next semester. 😂. @HayleyBCousin We sang it last week, but our ward boundary just changed, so there's a high probability that we will sing it today in our new ward as well. 😎. @HayleyBCousin What a great craving 😂. I'm crying, you're crying. We're all crying. 😭 https://t.co/3vUN8fMewY. I want a house and like $300k to decorate it. 😭. The answer is no. Maybe next year. 😂 https://t.co/8U9uqylqKA. I decided to do a lil side business for Christmas presents and it has been way more successful than I expected. 😳. @reno_lexi College boys are just dumb in general. @reno_lexi Just swear mean off and the moment you do the right one will walk in, happened to me. 😉. Have you ever come home so out of it that you knock ON YOUR OWN DOOR.. @HayleyBCousin I love this, thanks for sharing! ❤️❤️. I spent 2 days deeeep cleaning our oven and I've been so excited about it that I have shown everyone that's come over. 😂 Is this what being an adult means?!. I lasted a whole ten days before I caved and gave Zach his Christmas present 🤦‍♀️😂. @reno_lexi I knoooowwww ❤️❤️:'). Okay so my violin student texted me last night and asked what my favorite animal was and I woke up to this picture texted to me this morning. She's so pure and just my favorite. ❤️ https://t.co/H4tIoRSi5w. What even happened to this year?!. @morninghoneey My dad did both for a while a few years ago. He worked during the prime hours to get bonuses, I think he made upwards of $1,500 a week, but he did it full time.. @HayleyBCousin Locals in every college 'town' complain about this like it's their full time job. 🙄. @kirsylou I have a contact called spam that I block and I just continue to add numbers to the contact! I haven't had a spam call in months!!. So I'm in a wedding in 2 weeks and the bride just asked if I was bringing a plus one.

I said that I was going to try and go home with one of the groomsmen. 😏 

Zach is a groomsmen. 😉. @maegannoelle @gothcynic YES WF won't charge you until you're 25!!!. We got invited to a murder mystery party dinner last minute tonight, only knew 2 people, honestly went so we didn't have to make dinner. I ended up being the murderer. What.. I always see people posting crock pots for sale saying "I don't know how to use this" "don't have any good recipes" and I'm like how?!?

You literally throw stuff in at the beginning of the day and by the time you come home from work or school dinner is done?!? EASIEST THING EVER. Instagram already saw this, but here ya go Twitter! #IbottaHalloweenContest https://t.co/BNLFAbmtt3. *is like 0° in Idaho*
Me: I'm definitely grabbing a blanket tonight.....where is the blue blanket?
Zach: why wouldn't you just grab the brown one?!?
Me: because the brown one goes in the living room and the blue one goes in the bedroom because it matches
Zach: 🙄. Sometimes I think about how if I were to teach 20 hours of music lessons a week, I would be making the same amount I am working a full time job.. @kirsylou I figured it was something like that, maybe they have other public transport as an option?!? Let me know how it goes!!! A girls gotta go to Disney!!!. @kirsylou On another note, have you done Airbnb before?!? We've stayed at quite a few and normally you can get them for pretty cheap!!. @kirsylou I am pretty sure resorts see the fight price drops and they are like "hmmm more people will probably come, let's raise the prices. 😈". @kirsylou ISN'T THAT THE WORST. I have been raving about @IbottaApp to all my friends about all the savings. I literally got $25 back today for buying things we regularly use/eat. I just love it so much 😍. Me: maybe it's Maybelline.
Zach: yeah maybe you just rubbed butter all over yourself.
Me: what?!??!
Zach: Maybelline is butter right

😂. @kassadywright I am so sorry that you have to deal with that. ☹️ And it is not your fault, it's a two way street and you can't be the one making all the effort!. @kassadywright We only get to see my 4yo niece like maybe 4 times a year, but we understand since we live far away she doesn't always remember us. It breaks my heart that I don't get to be as present as I want to. 😥

They need to put in more effort. 🙄. Do you ever walk up to your apartment door pressing your key fob to your car wondering why the door isn't unlocked?

same. I'm having a Halloween party next week and I've literally been inviting everyone I know. 😂. @HayleyBCousin I had a feeling you would say that. 😊 Treat yo self!!! Baby showers are a thing for a reason. 😉. @HayleyBCousin @carlisajc Why are you so much cooler than me?!. @HayleyBCousin Are there any kitchen things you don't have/want to upgrade?!

Gift cards are super nice too, but your parents never struck me as the gift card type. 😂

If you can't think of anything for you guys, you could always ask for things for the future baby!. @HayleyBCousin @carlisajc Whenever we go to a game night and I like the game I add it to a list on Amazon!
-Codenames
-Telestrations
-Taboo. @ThatOMGkid My sweet pup passed from cancer a year ago, I hope they are running around chasing squirrels in dog heaven together! ❤️ https://t.co/fgAG0Fyj3U. My violin student brought me some candy tonight and told me I had to wait until after I ate my dinner to have it. 😂. @laceyloo17 @kyla_vo Clearly it's destiny, Kyla you HAVE to watch superstore 😂. @APlayaNamedZach hahahahaha 2 years into marriage and I learn this!!? https://t.co/mgYwt01rFQ. @kyla_vo I LOVE that show!!!! Zach hates how dramatic everything is 😂 Have you watched superstore?! It's on Hulu and I'm loving that right now, it's light humor so your heart won't get ripped out 56528 times.. In a span of one month, we will be going to a Colorado 3 times, two of which will be less than 36 hour trips. 🙃. One time when I was ten I was invited to a friend's birthday party and we had what I now realize was pho. I had never had pho or sriracha so I squeezed a whole bottle without thought, it was sriracha soup at this point. My poor lips were so burned and I just pretended to be okay.. @reno_lexi I had the SAME problem at your age. A few months after I swore off men I met Zach! It gets better, I promise! ❤️❤️. @HayleyBCousin At church of all places?!? 😂 https://t.co/CmiVqkFOi9. @reno_lexi I'm sorry love ❤️ I know how hard it is to be away from loved ones 💕. *gets sick in August*
Wow I all so lucky I am getting this before school starts!!
*gets sick, but 10x worse the second week of school* https://t.co/JJZ1u1wFaG. Didn't get the job this time, but it was reassuring to know I interviewed very well. I'll get ya next time. Netflix had the audacity to remove the show I was binge watching while on the last season.. There's a moth in our apartment and it flew in my face and I just about threw my lap top across the room.

Moth, I'm coming for ya. @cdr1317 Oh my LANTA!!!!. @cdr1317 https://t.co/31vbuhYjVX. @cdr1317 What a CHOMP. I was supposed to get an answer today. :') I really want the massive raise. :'). i have hated my past online classes discussion boards, but this semester my professor has an excellent sense of humor and a classmate posted a picture with her cute puppy

schools not that bad :'). @josieatk @bsimmonsjr You are still so young and a fresh graduate, especially with a nursing degree so many jobs are within your reach. Risk it for your dream now, and if things don't work out, you will get there. ❤️😊. @mmauser_3 I low-key want to read this now. @crucialstates @taylor_rogers13. My parents painted their house new colors and didn't even tell me. The audACITY.. I got an interview in 2 weeks!! 🤞as a wise man once said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Let's see what happens. 🙂. @kassadywright You are absolutely stunning ❤️❤️😍. @HayleyBCousin It definitely makes me question what this next generation will be like... Yikes.. @HayleyBCousin Right?!?. @HayleyBCousin Oh yes. This has happened with MULTIPLE people. 

Because of that, now no one ever wants to make dinners regardless if it's legit or not.

Our ward really struggles with ministering and wanting to serve or even show up for ward activities.. @HayleyBCousin Have you guys ever encountered "I don't feel good and my husband only knows how to make Mac &amp; cheese and I don't feel like that, can someone bring me dinner?". @HayleyBCousin SUE THEM. @kirsylou Thanks so much!! ❤️❤️. Tip of the day: scratch and sniff stickers are a great way to keep young violin students interested and actual practice!. I applied for the next position up with WF and I'm so nervous and excited all at once 🙃. @cdr1317 @HayleyBCousin YOU GUYS I WISH THAT WAS TRUE. Once I'm not working full time we will be getting a dog, that's a fact!!. I just got to pet a golden retriever puppy and all is good in the world again. tamales

I LOVE TAMALES. @deedledeeee You pull off short hair SO well. 😍. @reno_lexi Be in love with yourself ❤️. Today I finished 30 wedding thank you cards, only 50 to go. I am the best worst procrastinator. 😂 Will I finish before we hit 2 years? TIME WILL TELL.. @kassadywright Losing a loved one is hard. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about the many I've lost. But I try to picture them watching over me cheering me on and personally I believe that we will see them when we head to the other side. ❤️. Thanks for keeping me in check Twitter fam ❤️ https://t.co/wbPZZ1D7q0. Do I break my streak of 2 weeks without soda tomorrow and risk more caffeine headaches?!. @HayleyBCousin I want to finish but then I'm like https://t.co/1WfqQL5Srg. Whenever I receive thank you cards from wedding gifts it just reminds me that I HAVEN'T FINISHED MINE AND ITS BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF, SO I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON. I had a Halloween related dream the other night, so the only thing that makes sense is to start planning a Halloween party right?. Not sure who I am, but we got home from Colorado tonight and all within 30 minutes I changed the sheets on our bed, unpacked COMPLETELY with everything put back, and started laundry.. @bsimmonsjr I came across someone who named their daughter Humphrey. HUMPHREY. #stopwhitemoms2019. Do you ever get 'introduced' to someone and when they say bye they are like "it was so nice to meet you!" but on the inside you're like we knew each other as kids but okay 🤷. @HayleyBCousin 😂😂😂 oh Hayley. @HayleyBCousin Send me a picture!!!. @TaylorMamuzich You look so good!!!. I just counted all the butter in my parents house. 24 lbs worth of butter. What the heck do they need all that butter for?!. @HayleyBCousin @uofwhales I am with both of you on this. It's a shelf thingy. Not a cabinet.. The only thing keeping me alive right now is knowing I get Chipotle in 6 days. 

I haven't had Chipotle in 4 months. 😭. What if it's your husband? 🤔 https://t.co/B5sAwzSIZk. Whenever I see people with Captain America's shield or whatnot in the theater I instantly think "are you going to spawn into the movie and defeat Thanos yourself or what?". @makenzieg22 Wells Fargo hires at $15 an hour!! 😊 Message me if you have questions, I can put in a good word!. @TaylorMamuzich It's gonna be amazing, I can't wait!!! 😊😊❤️. Haha we are going to 5 weddings, one graduation, one family reunion and trying to plan a trip to Canada this summer. 😂. Zach and I just had the ultimate treat yo self day. 😂. What are the odds that we ran into our neighbors at a mall 30 minutes away AND they parked next to us 😂. @mmauser_3 I will go walking with you as long as it's not windy! 😊. I relate to this spiritually https://t.co/PTobGEGIR9. I see a whole bunch of friends getting fit or running marathons and it motivates me, but then I remember that I ate an entire pizza by myself for dinner. @imerzealous I'm glad it's not just me. 😂. Today this girl dropped off a resume with her wages/salaries for all her jobs, is this a normal thing to do? Please someone 😂. I honestly can't tell the difference between most 16 year olds and a 24 year old.. I was in my freshman year of high school 7 years ago, 7 years. That's wild.. Today I saw this girl carrying a cantalope and she straight up took a bite out of it, and then another bite. @yuhyepuhhuh WHAT THATS SO EXCITING!!!!!!. @yuhyepuhhuh A sister?!? What?? Is it Heidi and your dad's?!. The most exciting news I ever have is about my avocado plant and how miraculously I haven't killed it yet. 😂. @HayleyBCousin https://t.co/sEXGW7W7jC. Today at work I was talking to this gentlemen who I found was in town because his first grandchild was born, he was so excited!! He showed me an ENTIRE album of his cute new granddaughter. My freakin heart. 💓. Wow LinkedIn actually works, I just got a job offer, that's pretty neat. I want to be surprised that it's going to snow for 3 days straight leaving anywhere from 1-2 feet of snow but I'm not. 

I'm so sick of winter. 🙃. @makenzieg22 There's this girl I follow on insta, her tag is takingonworth but she is so motivational! She's a teacher so it's not like shes a student for say but she kicks butt!!!. @kassadywright https://t.co/p2cxFtfbNS. @mmauser_3 Why did trump auto capitalize. 🤦. @mmauser_3 I tried but her mom instincts Trump her listening skills 🤷. @TaylorMamuzich It better be edible. I can stay warm and have a snack at the same time. 😂. @TaylorMamuzich 😂 Idaho has changed me. My parents visited us this weekend and my mom yelled at me, in my own apartment, for not wearing a jacket in 17° weather.

It really never ends does it?. @kyla_vo I have been online shopping a lot and love Jane and Zulily! Everything I've bought has fit great and been good quality!. @HayleyBCousin OH YIKES. 😂🤣😂. @HayleyBCousin You're way ahead of me. I've written 30 and haven't even mailed them yet 😂. @HayleyBCousin Lesson I learned: don't procrastinate your thank you cards because then you will feel bad whenever you see people that got you something and decide to send them out anyways but to lighten how late they are you stamp and write this on each one https://t.co/wLWNmrhRTV. It is beyond me why our apartment builders didn't think a kitchen that has hardly any cabinet/counter space wouldn't need a pantry. 🙄. Me watching the episode of the office where Jim and Pam get married for the 56th time: don't cry don't cry don't cry
Me anyways: https://t.co/XksPbSeccT. @reno_lexi You are going to freeze when you move to Utah 😂. Today this cute little baby came, I asked the dad how old he was and he said "oh she's a girl!"
Me: https://t.co/N5ON7nMDoR. @reno_lexi "cold" 😅😅. @Lindsay_Renee31 I still love you ❤😅. @Lindsay_Renee31 Lindsay!!!! ❤❤❤. I do want to say I understand accidents happen when a payment you forgot about comes out, but when it's that many it's kinda hard for me to feel sorry for you.... Honestly though I've seen accounts with 40 overdrafts in a 6 month period and a lot of the causes were eating out a lot at not cheap places, going shopping for lavish things and  more

If you distinguish wants and needs its not an issue. Live. Within. Your. Means. BUDGET. 🤷 https://t.co/GEFVpmrO71. I stopped to get a pretzel from sodavine after work and lemme tell you, I've never smelled more heavenly carbs. @K_Rod1996 This is a pet peeve of mine, drives me up THE WALL 😐. I love parks and rec so much. @TaylorMamuzich what a time 👌❤ didn't we get cookies all the time too?. @TaylorMamuzich haha that 😂😂 do you remember me trying to figure out how many times I could 'accidentally' run into Kaed?!?. @TaylorMamuzich this is bringing me back to first hour freshman year. Zachs family is doing a reunion this summer and the first activity is a 5k.

Yikes.. @mmauser_3 PREACH IT GIRL. @mmauser_3 I think about this everyday. @HayleyBCousin I LOVE IT!!!!!!. @HayleyBCousin I hope you like it!!! 😊💄. I went to one high school party ever, not to drink but to see what it was all about.

The parents literally bought the alcohol for their own kids who were underage. THE PARENTS.. In a little over 24 hours I could be at a chipotle. @Lindsay_Renee31 Now I can afford to eat chipotle every meal when we come home 😍. @TaylorMamuzich You pull any color off so well like dang. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME LOOK WHO GOT A FREAKING PROMOTION 😊😊 https://t.co/BOCWxApJjX. @TaylorMamuzich Preach!!!!. They are playing with my emotions now. 😅 No news yet, with my luck I won't hear back till the holidays are over. 😆. Well today I had an interview for a lead position and I will find out if I got it today.

I am losing my mind. 🙃. @kassadywright Congrats!! 😊😊❤. We had a Christmas party tonight and had this convo with one of my friends 4 year old.

Him: What flavor is that gold soda?
Me: It's cream soda, it tastes like vanilla!
Him: *tastes it*
Him: THATS SPICY. I think we have a different wedding to attend every single weekend this summer. 

RIP to my paid time off. I just worked out for the first time in 2 years and I'm pretty sure I might be dead. @HayleyBCousin YES HAYLEY, YOU CAN DO THIS. Low quality selfie to show https://t.co/xIryHUMWXT. Man if you want a cheap matte liquid lipstick that lasts and looks really good, check out wet n wild. 

I've kissed Zach 20 times and not a bit of it has come off, no residue on my water glass or anything.

I'm shook.. @Lindsay_Renee31 This gets me everytime 😂. @Lindsay_Renee31 I appreciate that 🙏🙏 can we get together since I didn't get to see you in September?!? ❤❤❤. We fly home in 2 weeks.

Know what that means??

CHIPOTLE 
EVERY
DAY. Today my coworker asked me what I thought the most commonly purchased item at BYU Idaho is.

My answer: engagement rings. @HayleyBCousin That's all I'm picturing except swans 😂. @HayleyBCousin That's true 😂😂 it's like the ultimate prank have you seen this?!? https://t.co/uNqTmsKY3u. @HayleyBCousin Maybe someday when I'm rich 😂. @HayleyBCousin We almost did this for our neighbors. 😅 I was going to legit order 7 blow up swan floaties and leave them outside their door 😂 then I realized if I was that committed that it would cost a fortune. My cousin is drop dead gorgeous https://t.co/uisLiGu0Rv. Today I did ALL of our laundry. And you know the sad part? In 3 days there will be another mountain because I can never decide what to wear.. Today I did ALL of our laundry. And you know the sad part? In 3 days there will be another mountain because I can never decide what to wear.. I am so grateful dogs are a thing. So we're at church and I start going through Zach's suit coat pocket and I found some mints from Olive Garden!!! Blessings from above.🙏. @HayleyBCousin Yes!!! At first I thought he was just being a dork but he really thought that's how it was pronounced. 😂😂 I'll be laughing for decades about this.. Zach just asked if we could go to YAW-SO-MITE

I CAN'T BREATHE 

Yosemite. @kassadywright @kyla_vo Zach is the SAME you guys. It must be something in the testosterone. 🙄🙄😂. Sometimes I'll just eat plain cheese and Zach looks at me like I'm crazy. 🙄 He doesn't understand. https://t.co/zzxas3SlMN. @kassadywright I've been using Mary Kay matte foundation and I'm loving it!!. New cure for migraines: playing with a puppy. I love bacon. We are blessed with the best neighbors, we have been pranking each other with a giant rubber spider from Halloween and its just so pure. 😅. @HayleyBCousin RIGHT. My heart would have dropped to China once I saw that. 😭. @HayleyBCousin My manager once got to work and realized her center diamond was missing and she went home and found it in her BATHTUB NEXT TO THE DRAIN. Like what are the odds.. @HayleyBCousin NOOOOOOOOOOO!!! That's the worst!! 😭😭. Credit cards are crazy man, they just up my limits all the time and I'm not sure I should be trusted with that much buying power.... T- 2 weeks till I will get to eat chipotle again. 😊❤. We were watching a movie with friends and at 10:11 it dawned on me that I had homework due at 11.

It would be fitting that the lesson was on procrastination. 😅. Tonight I delivered cookies to my neighbors and after they opened the door I would say "reverse trick or treat!". Customer: what's my balance in checking?
Me: $247.65
Cust: Can I take out $100??
Me: Yeah of course here you go! Anything else?
Cust: Yeah what's my new balance?
Me: CAN YOU SERIOUSLY NOT DO THE MATH TO FIGURE THAT OUT ON YOUR OWN. https://t.co/I8C2yriAlP. @emileyvictoria No joke our neighbor says this at least 83 times a day. 😂. We are in Utah for the weekend &amp; somehow my zipper on my boots broke while I was sitting doing nothing. I only brought one pair of shoes so I told Zach it looks like I'll have to buy new shoes. He's now sitting here trying to fix them so he doesn't have to buy me new shoes. 😂. @kassadywright 😬😬 uh oh, looks like I'm doomed. 😂. Zach and I don't want kids for a few more years but I already have a baby registry of cool baby things I've come across.  😅. Man @twentyonepilots put out some bops on this new album. @JohnHam66024645 I don't need your sass. We have so many potatoes that I don't know what to do with myself. This one looks like a duck https://t.co/v6XnaiLa1t. I have learned so many important things about life in Idaho y'all

Gleaning: when you go back through the potato fields and pick up all the smaller/odd shaped potatoes that the machines missed. @HayleyBCousin I LOVE watching people get mad at other drivers when they were clearly the ones in the wrong. 😂. @Lindsay_Renee31 Like I wish I had a tamale dispenser instead of an ice dispenser. 😂. I can't stop eating tamales. @jane_rossta I love you janey. @HayleyBCousin I had a bunch of girls from RS over last night and we got real about this topic!!! Some women want to be moms, some want to pursue a career, some want to do both and any of these options are 100% okay. All I can think about is how in an alternate universe we would have a cute lil chocolate lab puppy today. 😢. I forgot how much I hate school settings with people making dumb remarks to try and get people to laugh. 🙄. @huntergeoff7 Pretty much fam. 👌. @huntergeoff7 Dude this is in Idaho, it's the rexburg campus. But like what the heck. 😅😅. @taylor_rogers13 This totally suits your style, I'm in love. 😍❤😍. You guys today I found out they have a thing called Spud Day in Idaho. One of the activities is tug of war... In a pit of mashed potatoes.

Everyone that attends gets a complimentary potato. 

YOU CANT MAKE THESE THINGS UP. @HayleyBCousin Super interesting read!! Thanks for sharing it!!. I accidently threw away $2,000 at work today, how's your day going?. @kassadywright The struggle is so real!!! 😭😭. Why is it that when I come home with a load of groceries all my cooking motivation goes down the drain?!?. @TaylorMamuzich Miss you bunches already 😘❤. We just got home after being gone for a week and holy cow. Look at my avocado plant!! It literally grew like 6 inches from when we left! https://t.co/F2B6VNdb0A. @TaylorMamuzich LOOK AT HER GO. @TaylorMamuzich I love you too!! 😘😘 We are in Denver on Sunday for a week I'd love to see your face and your cute chunk. ❤. Honestly though, moving out of state really shows who your real friends are and who really cares.. @imerzealous You should totally!! Potato everything! 😋 It's actually kinda like CO with surrounding mountains, weird weather, but so much less people!!. @emojoueur I honestly felt really stupid asking when the harvest was, they expected me to know 😅😅. In Idaho they talk about the spud harvest like its a national holiday. @sammieecat That's freaking BS though and terrible customer service. Good luck!!. I could've been productive for the whole day but ya know, in 3 hours I did dishes, laundry and changed the sheets on the bed. Start small though I guess. 😅. @sammieecat Girl you should call your bank/credit card company and dispute it as a fraudulent charge if they aren't refunding you!!. I want to put the Halloween decorations up today so bad. Our neighbors dog ran straight into our apartment today &amp; you can bet that I contemplated shutting our door &amp; pretending that we didn't see anything. It was the perfect dognap plan.. I'm way more excited than I should be about getting a storage unit for our extra stuff. 😅😅. It takes every ounce of self control I have in my body to not just spend thousands of dollars on clothes. @reno_lexi Are you obsessed with Lily James bc I am. @Maddi_Baylee_ If they do it should be illegal. 😂. My favorite part of making brownies is eating half the batter before I even bake them.. @kirsylou You go girl!! Better things are coming for you! 😊. I don't know what prompted my phone to go off and spit out random facts but now I know how much hippos weigh.. @TaylorMamuzich I love you ❤. I am starving and I keep watching the tasty videos thinking WHY CAN'T THIS FOOD MAGICALLY APPEAR IN FRONT OF ME WITHOUT ME DOING ANY WORK. @reno_lexi Girl you got this!!. I spent my lunch break looking at pictures of Honey, she's got bone cancer and has 3-6 months left. I knew this day would come, I'm just really sad. https://t.co/0NEsm5oNwV. I found the dog. https://t.co/80EkyCENfb. Our airbnb hosts would be LDS 😂 but apparently they have a dog that I somehow didn't notice and Zach said its a golden retriever, I can't wait to wake up and see it!!. @mmauser_3 @ChipotleTweets They would honestly get so much business in Rexburg, wanna open a franchise with me?? 😆. @mmauser_3 @ChipotleTweets I wish I was. 😭😭😭😭. They closed the @ChipotleTweets in Pocatello making the closet location to me 3 HOURS AWAY. I am so salty.. Our neighbors have a hedgehog and they were letting it crawl around on the grass while we conversed and she ran to lay between my feet and then she started nibbling at my toes.  😆😆 weirdest feeling ever.. Praying that I'll have some good news here in the next few days. 🤞🤞🤞. I got an access code for TØP fan tickets and I'm RELIEVED I won't have to pay $200 for resale tickets. 😌. The root was getting long enough to be upgraded to a glass!!! My life revolves around this seedling tbh https://t.co/48LySJdpAL. Who has recommendations of what to do in Seattle?? We will really only have one day there!. We got an airb&amp;b with a private beach for a STEAL. I'm so excited!!!. Sounds like we are going to Washington for the first time ever in a few weeks 😁😁. MY 🥑AVOCADO🥑 HAS STARTED A ROOT AND I'M SO EXCITED &amp; Zach has let me start a little farm with a bead storage container. 😅😅 https://t.co/LjKWeR3UKy. Me at the store calling Zach: "I found one of those foam kitchen mats so your  feet don't hurt, can I buy it??"
Zach: "as long as it isn't teal"
Me: 😐😶😶😶. @bsimmonsjr The sweet pork attracts them like crazy. I tag Zach on facebook posts of people selling their puppies from a litter and for the first time he liked my tag, slow progress, but progress nonetheless!!?. I don't know how much more eye rolling my eyes can handle. @TaylorMamuzich THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY 😊❤❤. Everyday when Zach comes home I always hope he will have a puppy with him to surprise me. 

I'm not giving up yet. @TaylorMamuzich EEEK THAT'S SO EXCITING. @HayleyBCousin The things you learn in marriage. 😅. @mmauser_3 Mosquitoes too dude.. Update #1: the pit has started to split, not sure if this is good or bad yet. 😬 https://t.co/1yiAB37XYP. @mmauser_3 You're 100% right, thanks babe 😘. After 3 years of graduating high school, I'm excited to announce that I will FINALLY be starting my degree in Fall 😅😅. @_MoniqueAndrea You'd be surprised how many people drive with expired temp tags, I would make a game to see who had the oldest one, I think the winner was about 9 months. 😅😅😅. Earlier today I saw a black ram with a customized licence plate that read "BLK RAM"

how original where did you come up with that??. There was a moose outside our apt today but I missed it because was sleeping. 😢. ...except the mannequin which was in the middle of the yard.

I waited a second, then a man came out of the house and he said, "OH you must be here for the mannequin!"

I quickly gave him the cash and put the mannequin in the passenger seat and took the HOV lane all the way home.. There was a note on his front door saying "I'm in the backyard, come on back"

This is where most people think wow I'm going to be murdered, better go home, nope not me, I went for it.

I start to walk around the corner of the house and see the backyard, no one was around except. One time for fathers day we got my dad a mannequin because he said he really needed an assistant at work.

I found it on Craigslist and drove through a neighborhood with many many turns, pretty much a dead end in a cul-de-sac.

I got out of my car and there was a note.... @mmauser_3 You met a boy?!? 😍😍. We had some friends over tonight and us gals were talking about obsessions with Bath &amp; Body works and VS lotions when ALL OF THE SUDDEN ZACH SAYS

"you can have all the clothes you want, just not lotions"

😲😲😲 SHOPPING SPREE

He went back on his words seconds  later.. I had a perfect avocado tonight, so I decided to take its seed and try to grow an avocado tree. It may take 3+ years to grow an actual avocado but I believe in you little seed ❤❤ YOU CAN DO THIS https://t.co/XQydOGVogX. In highschool I would take pictures of my friends if they fell asleep at school and then them into snap chat masterpieces. Those were the days. 😅 https://t.co/paLMPyxwbC. FINALLY, a day at work where I left feeling good about myself. It's about dang time!. @HayleyBCousin At least your ward has a choir. 🙄. We went on a lil hike today after not having been any sort of active for months and we followed it with Costa Vida and Zach wants to go on a bike ride now?? Does he not realize who he married? I'm taking a nap.. my coworkers: have any plans for after work??
me: I ordered a label maker so I think I'll go home and label EVERYTHING 

what a wild life I'm living. @mmauser_3 Your tweets are my favorite. @taylor_rogers13 You can count all the hairs flying off her as she sheds. 🙃❤. @taylor_rogers13  https://t.co/7sSagMsSMM. @kayl0kay Your sister is perfect. @Hayley_B3 Our old downstairs neighbor in a nutshell. 😭😅 I feel your pain!. @Hayley_B3 @amazon RIGHT???. @Hayley_B3 Thanks ❤❤ happy honeymoon!! 😘. Is it even worth trying to keep friends that don't seem to want to keep you?. @kyla_vo what the heck I'm crying, this is so pure 😭. Gas in Idaho Falls is $3.15 and I've seen it for $2.64 in Denver. Can someone explain this to me?? I just wanna talk.. SO FLIPPIN EXCITED FOR THESE 2 TODAY ❤❤ https://t.co/0Q9TMGPj1F. I still hate 120th just as much as I did before if not more. I am healed!. lol this is literally the worst timing for me to be sick. I did not get it, but that's okay, high spirits, something better is out there for me. 🤗. @Hayley_B3  https://t.co/9HlKrSUfKm. Still don't know anything about if I got the job or not. 😅 https://t.co/mm9uqjX23V. A gay man complimented me on my shoes today, I'm moving up in the world!. Now I can have anxiety until I find out if I got it not. https://t.co/0JnkcLjBtd. Had my interview today 😬. @NearMissLyss Oh my gosh it's called lysine not lupine. 😅😅😅. @NearMissLyss Definitely try it!! 😊 let me know if it works!. @NearMissLyss Get Lupine at Walgreen's or rite aid in the cold sore remedy section, literally makes it unoticeable and helps it heal super quick!!. @TaylorMamuzich No 😢😢. @TaylorMamuzich RIGHT?!? It made my night and made me feel whole.. A coworker tonight: "everytime I see you I think of pork chops". Why are you late for work??

Well you see I stopped for ice cream and it was all downhill from there. Last night I was trying to say lawn mower and not one but THREE times I said lawn MOANER. The customer could not keep a straight face. 💀💀💀. Might be able to get a promotion at Wells Fargo and quit my second job, but we all know how my luck goes lol https://t.co/GRS5rmKRIu. I was going to finish thank you cards today but watched movies and ate a whole pan of rice krispy treats instead. 😭😭. The other day at work someone brought their beagle puppy in and today I have seen a husky puppy named Shasta and a lab pit mix named Paisley SHE WAS A SWEETHEART. AND I SAW ANOTHER PUPPY. WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE.. Yesterday at the bank I helped this gentleman that spoke little to no English. I taught him numbers 1-10, should've seen the smile on his face. 😊. @kayl0kay Seriously though your eyelashes are like those of a goddess goddang. I changed my notification sound to baby groot and my life is complete. So these cute little boys came in with jars full of change to deposit.

Me:"wow are you saving up for something?"
Him:"yeah a mission!!"
Me:"so you must be helping out a lot!"
Him: "no I took the change from my dad." *mischievous laughter*. @AndyMan096 Low-key super down. I was on the 2nd flight of stairs up to my apt and dropped my phone and it hit the ground. To my surprise it landed face up and undamaged I declare it a MIRACLE. 🙏. I CAN'T HANDLE THIS 😂😂 https://t.co/UAvPI6lThK. With enough time I think Zach will start enjoying watching Fixer Upper with me 🤞🤞. @APlayaNamedZach I love you even though you're mean. 😊. Today there was a guy riding a bicycle and hit cat was happily perched on the handlebars and then he put a leash on it and brought it in the bank and then they left and the cat got right back up on the handle bars 😂😂 I have officially seen it all. Sometimes I like to wear my Mary Jane (the ski slope) slope to mormon events just to see who gets stirred up and who gets the joke.. And I had to explain to the employee that I'm just dumb and forgot to order??? What the heck is wrong with me. 😂😂. Y'all Monday hit me hard. I forgot my phone at home and went the whole day without it. And then I got Wendy's for lunch and I drove through the drive through all the way to the window without ordering any food because I was distracted?? But I didn't even have my phone??. @Hayley_B3 Dude I legit got a random one from Target and it was from a guy in Florida and we had no idea who he was. Still to this day.. @Kassiegirl33 Thanks ❤❤😘. This gives me hope that Zach will get me a lil doggo 😊😊 https://t.co/hTXLtteL8Q. I met a cute 6yo black lab named Sky that just got adopted from a shelter and she was so excited to see people and bounced around. Zach last night: I can't wait to surprise you with a puppy!! 😊

how about right now???. I already ate all my snacks for after work between jobs

tragic. There's a guy at my apartment complex with a dog named PINEAPPLE. Idk what it is about dogs names after food but it makes me so happy. Why did no one ever tell me that I walk weird??!?!. I get to see my dogs in a little over a month!!!!!!. I had these customers, a cute couple and I had to ask for the husband's ID and the wife was like "this one time I took paper and taped it over his real name and wrote Spock because he looks like Spock." HE DIDN'T NOTICE FOR OVER A MONTH.. The closest chipotle is an hour away and I've been craving it like no other and Zach made us some tonight. 😊❤. Also the Wells Fargo branch in Rexburg has like 4 tellers from Colorado and I'm jealous I don't get to work with them. 😭. There's a guy at our apt complex that runs with his 2 labs in the morning and the dogs normally run around carrying a giant stick in their mouth but today they had a huge chunk of ice and it was THE CUTEST thing ever. Best way to start my day.. Had a conversation with a customer that is working on breeding new types of potatoes. 😂😂 ONLY IN IDAHO. There was a mom at church today showing her toddler pictures of dogs on instagram to keep her occupied. If that isn't my future. 😂. I don't have business cards at work yet so I take someone else's and cross their name out and write in my own name.. *Zach goes to open a box of girl scout cookies*

"LAURA you ate half the box?? I'm never going to get to taste these at this rate."

*high five*. Not the actual Michael Scott though,  but he was a huge fan of The Office 😊. You guys I met MICHAEL SCOTT TODAY. Zach: I hope our kids get my thumbs because yours are weird.

Same. I eat myself into food coma far too often. Me: I just need to make a ganache for the brownies and I'm done!
Zach: what's a galache. Zach took half of them down this morning to shave his face.. WHO will take the heart down first?????. So Zach added another layer of the heart... https://t.co/CEqo5wE7Vm. And a school was on lock down because there was A RAGING BULL ON THE LOOSE. You can't make this stuff up!!!!. https://t.co/FSiPJssl9t. How long before Zach takes the hearts down??. There were chickens loose on the highway today. I CANT WITH IDAHO. 😂. At work helping this cute elderly couple

Him: just slide the card already!
Her: you doofus it's chip reader.

Goals.. I pulled out my viola for the first time in a YEAR and I miss playing 😞😢. @Hayley_B3 I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING 😂😂. Zach: Stop looking at dogs, we aren't getting one anytime soon.
Me: That's what you think.. Zach: Stop looking at dogs, we aren't getting one anytime soon.
Me: That's what you think.. I went to Target intending to make bad financial decisions but I only bought things I needed 😂. Me: I love cracking my back
Zach: I love cracking a cold one open with the boys. My morning commute is great. No traffic. Coming home the only complaint is that people are only going 5 over when I want to go 10 over. 😂. Twitter, I am no longer unemployed!!  I have never felt more relieved! 😊. @Hayley_B3 OMGOMGOMGOMG BEST THING EVER. I love mine!!!!. @Hayley_B3 We bleed Colorado. 😂. We met some people from CO in the  hot tub tonight and the first thing we all said was TAKE I25 TO EXIT  235 THEN 5 MILES WEST TO THE TREE FARM. AND ABOUT HOW WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH BINGING TV SHOWS. WHAT EVEN. 😂😂😂😂. I have done so many interviews that I started talking about HIMYM AND I THINK THAT MADE THEM LIKE ME MORE 😂😂. @_MoniqueAndrea Dude literally same. Only regret of getting married is that I could've had a TV show on HGTV called Reno-vation. Opportunity missed.. I want to buy a house up here and remodel it like Chip and Joanna Gaines. 😭😭. I made banana bread and brownies but have yet to start dinner 😂. @Kassiegirl33 Praying for you 🙏🙏. @Kassiegirl33 There is still hope!! 😊 it's so fun to raise kids with a dog to grow up with!! 😊. I'm hoping that the more pictures of cute dogs I show to Zach the sooner he will allow me to get one. 😍. I may or may not be in a position where 2 branches are fighting for me.. It's almost 4 and I still haven't heard back yet. 😭😭😭 going to fill my sorrows with carbs. https://t.co/7Lazt9TFEr. TWITTER FAM HELP ME. Do you keep your milk handle facing out (A) or keep it facing in (B)? Picture for reference in comments. 🐮. Zach made a mac and cheese quesadilla and I've never been more proud to call him my husband. I will now hear back on Thursday. Send positive vibes my way!! 😬. @Lindsay_Renee31 Thanks bb ❤❤. @mmauser_3 Her baby is going to be a first class chocoholic. 👌. https://t.co/C0rg4Oth3f. Well I didn't hear anything back yet, that could be good or bad 😂😂 haha it's fine. Y'ALL I FIND OUT IF I GOT THE ASSISTANT BRANCH MANAGER POSITION TODAY which is wild because I'm only 21. Keep praying for me. 😂😭. @mmauser_3 I'm going the whole 9 yards man. I'm gonna make fudges, cakes, brownies, everything 😍. Honestly pregnant friends are the best because now I can bake goodies and she can eat them all and be my taste tester while filling her cravings. @Lindsay_Renee31 Get one for me babe!!! 😘. DANG IT I WANT CHIPOTLE AND THE CLOSEST ONE IS AN HOUR AWAY. @ririquinn @alysssareyes Literally my favorite website. You ever think you aced something and then you start over thinking and now you think you did terrible? 

me rn. Man I really wish I didn't have to get a job, then I could get a dog and stay home and play with it all day 😂😭. @Lindsay_Renee31 I'm the worst. 😂😂. @Lindsay_Renee31 My goodness I'll text you the link I'm terrible. @Lindsay_Renee31 I think I filled out job applications with Reno which is bad because I already switched my social over 😂😂 I'm still getting used to it too man. I MISS YOU. @TaylorMamuzich This is the best thing I've heard. Today's interview went awesome! Keep your fingers crossed for me so I don't have to be unemployed anymore 😂😭😂. I have so many thank you cards to write but I think I'm just gonna stay in bed. At this rate I'm going to have like 6 interviews this week 😂😂 if I don't have a job by the end of this I'm going to kill someone. I have an entire cabinet just for potato items. Our apartment has a year round hot tub and im about to abuuuuuse that privilege. @kayl0kay I was about to say we should hangout and then I realized I'm in Idaho 😭😭. Me grilling random BYUI freshmen: it's halfway through the first week of school and you aren't engaged yet?!?. I have put so many job applications out there. 1 interview this week, 1 next week. #prayforlauratogetajobsoonsoshedoesnthavetobumitoutalldayinanapartment. You guys Idaho is great, there is no traffic and everyone understands that the left lane is for passing!🙏. Have you ever walked up to your apt on the THIRD FLOOR and realized you left all the groceries in the trunk. 

same. I feel attacked https://t.co/KvEnoLJZdl. The apartment is so cute 😁😁. Also today we discovered I have an absurd amount of bath and body works lotion lol. My brother decided a 16 foot truck wouldn't work for our stuff so now we have a 26 foot truck with no extra charge because he talked Penske into it. Like what did I come home to.. Came back home and Zach's sister and friends have packed my entire room, I now know where nothing is but it's okay!! 😂. Ran into the SAME lady at the DMV and I told her about how I got my first ticket on the way to get my drivers license 

lol. Some lady switched me numbers because her daughter wasn't there yet so now I'm next 😭 FINALLY SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENED. Now I'm stuck at the social security office and then the dmv to try and get my name changed before we move TOMORROW. And I still have to pack everything pretty much

lol. Update on Laura moving tomorrow: I now have 3 boxes packed

lol. Do I not realize I'm moving this weekend. @Hayley_B3 "oh it's auto correct". I have been -8 productive since I got home from work. All my regular customers are getting me cards and lil gifts and it honestly makes me want to cry 😭. @Hayley_B3 IM CRYING BECAUSE THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY.. lil plush penguin: $12
my 2 year old niece's reaction: PRICELESS

she was so happy and just hugged it for like 5 minutes straight and I love her ❤. @Lindsay_Renee31 I LOVE YOU. A year later and we're  married. 😊❤ I love Zach so much. 😊 https://t.co/kuqcpKRNBw. @Lindsay_Renee31 I love you 😂😂. @mmauser_3 Dude my dad didn't know either and I was shook. Mr. Stevens came to the bank today  and I told him that I'm getting married on Saturday and he got so excited 😭😂 literally the best teacher from High School. Honestly contemplated driving into a ditch so I wouldn't have to work today. Am I crazy???

yes. Me: I should really stop eating so many sweets because I have a wedding dress to fit in, but like it's Christmas season so how can you not???? Maybe I'll just workout super hard and have abs the next day, yeah that should work.. @Lindsay_Renee31 Girl get on that 😂😂😂. 5 months went to 3 months to 1 month to 2 weeks to THIS WEEK. ITS MARRIAGE WEEK Y'ALL. 👰🤵💒. I sound like I smoke 4 packs a day, don't know how I'll get through the day tomorrow 😂. ROUND 2 OF INTERVIEWS NEXT WEEK!!!. And we move to Idaho in 3 weeks, I kinda would like to know if I have the job or not. 😂. So now the branch is waiting till I finish my rounds of banker interviews before they make a decision on either position. 🙃 I'm losing my mind y'all. Like I'm thinking I won't get my second round of interviews next week which is the week I GET MARRIED.. Update on Laura finding a job in Idaho: I had an interview for lead teller (which is my current position) about 2 weeks ago and the next day a banker position opened at the same branch so I was like heck yes I'll apply for that!!. Phone interview in t-40 minutes are I hardly have a voice 🙃. I would get sick a week before the wedding 🙄🙄. @_MoniqueAndrea Thanks girly 😊❤😊. My life will forever be a cycle of me eating too much food. I always thought it was weird when couples got wedding photos done before the actual wedding, now I fall in that category 😂. Thanks twitter ❤ looks like we will have a bomb filter at the wedding 😎 https://t.co/6aaRRCPSkv. @TaylorMamuzich Why are we like this. @TaylorMamuzich There's a sale??? ILL TAKE TEN. Apologizing to Zach in advance for how much stuff I have like holy cow. @taylor_rogers13 Someone either hates snap chat filters or is heckin trolling me. Should we have a snap chat filter at the wedding?. I literally want to shove my phone in strangers faces and make them look at how cute our wedding photos are turning out 😂. @CarlsonTeagan Yo girly just start wearing less and less, if you have acne/acne scaring and that's whats holding you back I have some good recommendations ❤. I am so lucky to have Zach in my life, he is just the sweetest human being that I know 😊❤. @APlayaNamedZach Really?? What a coincidence!!. "if you live in the hood tap water is no good". I came into work this morning and everyone brought cakes and cookies galore. At least I ate healthy for 2 days. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. ITS THE MONTH OF MY WEDDING. @Hayley_B3 @TMobile @JohnLegere Did you get a new number... Because if so I sent pictures of me in my wedding dress to a COMPETE STRANGER. The dress is gorgeous but I've gotta lose like 7 pounds. 😂😂😂. EEEEEEEEEK I finally get my wedding dress back tomorrow I can't wait to see the final product. 😁😁. Zach is getting heckin spoiled for Christmas this year. ❤😊. @mmauser_3 No joke Zach's sister wanted to do once today and I was like heck to the no.. @Hayley_B3 are they at least texty texts?. @Lindsay_Renee31 Girl you are perfect the way you are! 😘😊. I get married in 31 days. That's wild.. I really miss the Joe Biden memes. 😞. There was a spider at work today while I was strapping my cash, you best bet I left the 20k sitting out and ran to the other side of the bank after screaming SPIDER. @Kassiegirl33 He'd be so mad if he found out I watched without him though 😭. The self control its taking me to not watch the last episode of Stranger Things without Zach is going to kill me. WE GOT INTO THE APT COMPLEX WE WANTED AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER TO KNOW WE HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE IN IDAHO ❤. November 1st is the day to blast Christmas music while eating half off Halloween candy 🤙. Me at the doctors office today: "I see you dressed up as a doctor for Halloween". The recruiter nixed that one but had me apply for a different banker position. Stay tuned 😊. This whole marriage thing is getting super real 😁😬 54 MORE DAYS. I decided to hand write all the addresses for invites and they look super good but I'm only 24 in out of like 400 😭😭. Interview #1 for a banker position in Idaho Falls today. 😬😁. Not sure what happened to Zach but Bob Ross is pretty cute. 😉 https://t.co/oDkUoGqj34. Also y'all if you haven't already given me your address for a wedding reception invite please message it to me. 😊. Honestly Zach and I's costume might actually top my scuba diver  &amp; shark from last year 😏. @Hayley_B3 This brought tears to me. ❤ I know he does. ❤ love you hayhay. Every year gets a little bit better but you never leave my heart. ❤. Zach will lock his car doors right before I get there just so he can open the door for me 😂😭 chivalry is not dead. I went ten hours without my phone because I left for work with my phone charger but not my actual phone. 🙄 smh. @kayl0kay It might be sweat.  😂😂 I love you ❤. @emojoueur Yes we are heading up in January! 😊. So in love 😊😘❤ https://t.co/cUlmeBQCr6. Only me and only in Vegas. The bachelor party is tonight so I went to the store &amp; I ran into this random girl and she told me her life story and then offered me a job. If you ever want to bamboozle a chick fil a worker say "my pleasure" when they give you your food. They will have no idea how to respond. 😂. Meeting people for the first time in Utah:

"How long did you date before you got engaged?". I'm probably going to have in n out tomorrow and my stomach is already happy. 😌. Just kidding, next Monday. I don't know how to read. 😂. I get to see my dress in pretty much the final stage tomorrow 😁😁. @DonovanC15 @eerinedwards They're migrating 😊. I'M CRYING WHY WAS I LIKE THIS. I don't know how I'm going to top last year's costume 😤 https://t.co/2rBdnPVRY5. @reno_lexi SEND THEM TO ME. I LIVE FOR MEMES. I have a feeling Zach will be super mad when he sees how many clothes I have even after getting rid of stuff. @Cienna_Ruth Patience. 😊❤ I'm sure those girls are super grateful even though they don't know you.. @Cienna_Ruth Don't give up ❤❤ I promise you'll find that person that makes you feel less the only girl in the world. ❤. @Kassiegirl33 I don't think that we were thinking at all. 😂. @Kassiegirl33 Girl my eyebrows are just now recovering from all the abuse I put them through in middle school 😂. Idk what it is but all of my violin students improved a TON this week. My heart is so happy. ❤😊. @EVR_dedpewl Zach and I are almost done and I already want to cry. IT'S MY DAY OFF AND MY BOSS IS TEXTING ME MEMES. Me: so are we carving pumpkins
Zach: why would I participate in the BEST THING ABOUT FALL, WE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING FALL RELATED.. @taylor_rogers13 @CuteEmergency A very welcomed intruder. One named Lugnut said you should not adopt him if you have kids because he's big and will knock them over and lick their face. 😭😂. I was looking at saint Bernard adoption pages for who knows what reason other than to look at cute dogs. @Hayley_B3 @BYU @Sodalicious I would try coke first, can't go wrong with a classic cola!  😊😊. @Hayley_B3 @BYU @Sodalicious I want a video posted of you drinking soda. @Hayley_B3 @BYU @Sodalicious YAY  I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU 😁. Honestly though the cat makes this picture https://t.co/5wLoiJys0L. Engagement pictures are DONE 😊😊. Lol. Like the fact that your engagement pictures are tomorrow but your ring is off getting resized. You know when you go to bed and you suddenly remember something important. Like jeeze slow down so you don't choke 🙄🙃. Everything is making me mad, my mom asking a million questions, the sound of my dad eating which is actually really loud. They put a Michael's in right by where I work and they bank with us and keep bringing coupons over. This is dangerous.. For my twitter friends too. Fill this out so we can mail you an invite! 😊❤
https://t.co/42smEdve6K. 100 more days 😊❤. @mmauser_3 THIS HAS ME DEAD. Zach is just the best and I don't know what I did to deserve him. ❤😭. @TaylorMamuzich Same, let's pretend to be crafty together. @TaylorMamuzich Praying4u. I think I might be more excited about decorating the apartment than I am for our wedding. 😂. I'M SCREAMING. I JUST REMEMBERED I GET TO MARRY MY BEST FRIEND. @TaylorMamuzich @StayMetal11 These are my favorite. ❤❤ can't freaking wait for you guys!!. Photographer is booked. I'm slowly planning my wedding!!😁. @reno_lexi I got a new phone so I don't have any 😭😭😭 but as soon as I get it back I'll send you some 😊. MY DRESS IS SUPER CLOSE TO BEING DONE AND I'M SO EXCITED. The nice thing about hobby lobby/Michaels is that if I want to make wedding decorations I can because winter stuff has been out for 3 months. @Lindsay_Renee31 DEAD. Zach is the real MVP https://t.co/UajeP7FSZf. @elenarentz Tell them you forgot you need to take your fish for a walk.. I LOVE MY DOG SO MUCH I CAN'T WAIT TO GO HOME AND PET HER https://t.co/MKfkdZ4pwL. Ready to avoid family drama and just elope.. I say this often but I cannot handle people that chew with their mouth open/make loud noises. LEARN SOME MANNERS. My freaking WEDDING IS COMING https://t.co/fWyQneBrxV. I can always count on @taylor_rogers13 to hype the openers for any concert. I freakin adore it.. My favorite part of the eclipse is definitely all the memes that came from it 😂. Chick fil a sauce is pretty high on the list too https://t.co/D69kPH7ZoI. I'm going to be so productive today!

*Lays in bed until ten
Eats food
Lays on couch*. Zach last night: "you look so happy when you're eating food". Too bad that Zach has little say  in the color schemes of the kitchen bathroom and bedroom. All my HGTV watching has finally paid off. @Hayley_B3 It's extra hard because we don't actually have an apt yet to know what fits/ what we need. @Hayley_B3 OH MY HECK. We have to get ours finished by the end of September when we send announcements out 😂. Working on this wedding registry will probably be the death of me. If I could stop feeling nauseous that would be great. If I could stop feeling nauseous that would be great. @TaylorMamuzich 6 years has done us miracles my dude. I absolutely love seeing other people happy, it just warms my heart 😊. Drunk people talk so loud lol. Already full of regret!. @Kassiegirl33 Once I find the happy medium between binging and sleeping I will deem myself successful in life. 😂😂. I got in bed at 8 and have been watching Netflix since then WHY AM I LIKE THIS. I am going to hate myself tomorrow for staying up this late. I haven't taken a decent selfie in months and I think tomorrow is my day 🤙. I get to put my dress on again tonight 😍😍 it's so gorgeous you guys I feel like a princess.. Haven't been to chipotle in a month and I went today and all the workers were like GIRL WHERE YOU BEEN. All I think about anymore is how many potatoes I'll get to eat in Idaho, so freaking hyped. I just want Zach to come home, he makes everything better. Can't do or say anything without offending someone in my family anymore 😂. I FOUND THE DRESS, IT WAS THE THIRD ONE I TRIED ON ❤😊❤👰🤵. @mmauser_3 Sounds like a fool proof plan to me! 😊. @Hayley_B3 I'll have to look into that! 😊😊. @Hayley_B3 RIGHT?? 😊 that's what we're going for!. @Hayley_B3 Like a maroon/burgundy and greys/charcoal. 😊. @Hayley_B3 Tell me about it. 🙄 Like did y'all forget it's about me and not you?!? I have no idea what I need help with yet, but for sure girl!! ❤❤. @Hayley_B3 SERIOUSLY THOUGH.. Eloping just keeps sounding better and better. I'm going dress shopping tomorrow and I'm just crossing my fingers that the first one I try on works perfectly. 😂. Long distance is one thing but not having any form of communication SUCKS.. A wasp flew into my car while I was driving today and my life flashed before my eyes 😂😭. Zach is gone on a cruise for the next week and I'm having major withdrawals already. 😞. Life hack: wear sunglasses to hide the bags under your eyes.. Florida is so humid I can't with this. I think my stress has stress but I'm just going to pretend that everything is okay. Same https://t.co/N3u5Ha8CE0. I'm at the point where I'd have as much luck ordering a dress online as I will finding one in stores. 😂 UGH.. My favorite thing is to get everyone at work wound up about how to pronounce Arvada 😂 https://t.co/pHa1OqNuyX. @emojoueur I saw that and it had me dying 😂. @mmauser_3 I can't win. Part. 2 of why I can't wait: there's going to be next to no traffic because the population in Idaho Falls is HALF OF THORNTON ALONE. I'M SO OBSESSED https://t.co/umvkPs5WIe. Can't wait to move to Idaho and have potatoes for every single meal of the day!. I JUST WANNA SLEEP. When will people realize that account numbers are completely different than your debit card numbers 🙄. @Hayley_B3 December 23rd 😊❤. Looking at apartments for Zach and I makes me feel like I'm on house hunters. 😂😂. https://t.co/km2ku9LZFI. He actually proposed tonight 😊💍. So now Zach thinks it's funny to fake propose to me  He's a freaking turd but I still love him. ❤. Zach and I have been rewatching the office &amp; SPOILER we are at the part where Jim keeps fake proposing to Pam because she knows it's coming. What really sucks is wanting to tell someone who used to be your best friend something huge and you get left on read.. @taylor_rogers13 LITERALLY ME. The pineapple is back 😈 https://t.co/02OIOEWksr. She did not deserve those puppies. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD DO THAT. so I obviously stopped her because the puppy would have freaked out being in such a confined area and WHAT THE HECK. So I jokingly said she should put the puppy in the little slider thing so I could cuddle it AND THIS LADY WAS ABOUT TO DO IT. This lady came through the drive thru today and had 2 pitbull puppies and they we so dang cute. Being in love is by far the best feeling. What a great night doing totally legal things. 😉😊 thankful for a good group of friends ❤❤ https://t.co/S2a6b12ohQ. Tube thief Keith took a week to bring it back and he left it OUTSIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. THANKS KEITH.. His name was Keith so I obviously nicknamed him TUBE THIEF KEITH which is insanely hard to say. Last Tuesday a guy took the tube and I called him and asked if he would bring it back he was like SURE MAN SORRY BOUT THAT BRO. And then we have to spend time figuring out who in the heck took it (normally an elderly person). So people accidentally take the tubes from bank drive thru ALL the time. @Hayley_B3 YES I was home alone for 2 hours and was exhausted.. @K_Rod1996 YES THIS IS WHAT I LOVE TO HEAR. @Hayley_B3 That's kinda where I'm at too. 😂 HTC just put a new phone out and in really considering that.. I've been an Android user forever and now I'm considering switching. Can y'all tell me why you love iPhones so much.. THERE IS NOTHING I HATE MORE THAN LOUD EATERS. LEARN TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHILE YOU CHEW.. I swear no one is afraid to cross the line. In the airplane:

Please walk down the aisle and put your luggage in the overhead bins.. At the temple:

Hopefully the next time you guys come back it'll be for your sealing (marriage)!. At family event:

"Make sure to let us know about any big announcements coming up. 😉". I will never learn my lesson to let my food cool off before I eat it. The roof of my mouth is dead.. She has walked by us twice and still not seen us. I just spotted her and made eye contact and she just called asking where we were 😂😂 https://t.co/k9nbf90JSV. My mom has gone missing in the airport no clue where she went 😂. "I think menopausal women having hot flashes are the real cause of global warming." - My Mom. I'm trading 65° weather for 112° nope just nope. You know you're eating good if you have to undo your belt after a meal. @Hayley_B3 I am 100% down. @Hayley_B3 I'm about ready to get monopoly money and give it to rude customers. Might lose my job but who cares!. I kinda love it when people get mad at me for bank policies/doing my job the right way like sorry you don't get everything your way Pamela.. It's official. I'm moving to Idaho in January possibly sooner 😬😁. @kyla_vo That's what my life has come to. 😂. Goals https://t.co/925Hl596Wx. Also I got home before both my parents tonight. They're wild.. I barely survived 95° today and I'll be in 120° weather in AZ this weekend. RIP Laura. I found pudding in the fridge and brought it work and it expired in 2014 HOW DID THAT STAY IN THE FRIDGE FOR 3 YEARS?!?. @reno_lexi I'm super excited 😊😊❤. I'm so in love and it's the best thing ever. @Hayley_B3 I'm just giddy with life 😊. Eeeeeek 😊😊😊❤. Free garlic knots!!!!!!. One more week and I'll be in AZ 😊😊. Zach's dad gave me the link to the blog from Zach's mission in South Africa and I'm falling more and more in love 😍❤. A customer brought me an ORCHID. People are so nice. 😊❤. OH MAN A CUSTOMER IS BRINGING ME A BREAKFAST BURRITO TOMORROW AND I COULDN'T BE MORE HYPE. @Lindsay_Renee31 Same.. OH MY GOSH WHITE. best/worst typo?. I just realized I'm totally dressed like a whore suburban mom 😂😂. I saw Stevens today at work and it honestly made my day!!!!! Haven't seen him in 2 freakin years!. @Hayley_B3 (⊙＿⊙). @taylor_rogers13 I captured a rare photo of the Colorado shark and tamed it https://t.co/Fz6vx3FyZC. @taylor_rogers13 The Colorado river shark. I'm still not sure how this happened but when I opened my car door I hit myself in the eye and I'm pretty sure it'll be a black eye tomorrow. I love watching movie credits to see the weird names. In Wonder Woman there's a guy with a middle name of Groot HOW COOL. Going for a run was a mistake I can't feel mah legs 😵. Seriously still don't know how I scored him. I'm a little obsessed. I found a guy that is more than willing to dress up to attend festivities 😊😍 https://t.co/2HXwF9IqQ4. I can't wait for the last hail damaged vehicle to be sold so I can stop hearing these radio commercials about hail sales. Zach's sister is the cutest and made macaroons and left a note to not eat them because they were for Zach and I 😂❤. Y'all Zach meets my entire family in 2.5 weeks. Wowza. Hopefully they don't scare him away.. @TaylorMamuzich I know we don't talk much but I'm always here for you babe!!!. @Hayley_B3 THEY ARE SO MUCH FUN TO DRIVE!!!. What goofballs https://t.co/L0UENvi146. I have a huge compilation of videos of Zach trying to dunk a basketball but hard core failing instead. I love him so much 😊. @Hayley_B3 Thanks Hayley :'). So far I have done 2 loads of laundry and gone to lunch with my dad.. My productivity level today is at a solid -28. When you go to the car dealership with Zach and the salesman asks if you're married 😂😂😂. @kayl0kay same. @kayl0kay NUH UH. U WANNA FIGHT??. @kayl0kay I love YOU 😘. @kayl0kay I made a pun fair at=ferret GET IT. I already know I'm lame, no need to remind me.. It wasn't ferret all lol. Today someone brought their ferret into the bank and let it loose. People are wild.. @Hayley_B3  https://t.co/KhAuQuoL2P. @Hayley_B3 I've been sitting here thinking about all the logistics and I'm just like WAT EVEN AM I DOING. The fact that I'm uprooting my life in 6 months and moving to Idaho is super mind blowing. If you have not had coconut hot chocolate you are missing out. Zach and I went on a bike ride to the dog park to go look at cute doggos this evening. He's my favorite. 😊. @Lindsay_Renee31 Lunch tomorrow?!?!. @Lindsay_Renee31 YES YES YES YES PLEASE ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW??. I could listen to Zach play the piano for hours, he's so freaking talented ❤😍❤. I didn't spill any of my lunch on myself today. Do I get an award?!. I spent way too much money today but I also deserve it because I work my butt off. IT'S TOO SPICY, I'M WHITE I CAN'T HANDLE THIS. Smiling moose messed up my order but I'm not even mad. The best decision prior to this is dating Zach of course 😊❤. I got a rocky road milkshake on my lunch and oh boy THIS IS THE BEST DECISION IVE MADE IN 5 MONTHS. Okay it got worse... my food was too hot so I made ANOTHER snack. Do you ever make yourself a snack while you're waiting for your actual food to be ready because same. @K_Rod1996 I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING. I'm still trying to figure out why this kid was walking around with a broom. While driving I saw 3 kids, each carrying their mode of transportation

1 had a scooter
1 had a skate board

But the last... he had a broom. My sunburn is so bad and I hate myself for it 😭. I turned a corner and my coworker was bending down and her neon pink thong was all I could see and my day is pretty much ruined. Do chick fil a employees get paid out on hour often they say my pleasure in a single transaction or. 6k for the jeep to get fixed from all the hail damage. How about no. 😭. The only good news I'll get today is probably that my insurance deductible is only $250. I really should start warning people that my shifter knob comes off holy potatoes.. My dad has spent more time with my boyfriend than me today. What the heck.. *sneezes twice*

I'm allergic to work send me home.. Village Inn brings us pies every Wednesday and this the reason I'll be fat in a few months. Still stands true ❤😊😊 https://t.co/tTMoYB5jo3. @dedpewlLoL https://t.co/E3AJRYFQJ7. He literally charges full speed at you and then just cuddles. SO CUTE.. Zach's uncle has a corgi, I'm in heaven https://t.co/i4mAqreNG1. This is what matters to my mom 😂😂. And he plays my favorite song on piano. He likes coconut. Me: Zach is probably the best guy I've ever dated.
My mom: I would have to second that, the family hasn't scared him away yet. @Lindsay_Renee31 YOU'RE KILLING ME WITH THIS 😂😂😂. What a weight lifted off my shoulders 🤗 I don't think I've ever been more relieved in my life.. 2 more hours then I get to spend the weekend with bae 😊. Just gotta remind myself that once I get through today I have a 5 day weekend. Zach is everything I could ever dream of and I still have a hard time wrapping my mind around the fact that he's real. @Mariniciaaaaaa I have GA tickets you're more than welcome to chill with me :). When you let your mom use your jeep and she hasn't driven stick in more years than you've been alive.. The face I make whenever Zach makes a stupid joke/pun https://t.co/rf7WWpjIiV. @Lindsay_Renee31 I think I'm going to throw up 😷. I asked my manager and his response was Highison Ford. I'm not even mad. 😂. @nate_wethington It's funny in Alderaan places.. What do you call Harrison Ford when he smokes weed?

Han So-HIGH 

lol. Why did the pot head plant cheerios?

Bc he thought they were DONUT SEEDS!!!!

lol. It's probably because I'm blonde with blue eyes.. I got a compliment that I have beautiful eye balls from this girl that had a picture of Hitler on her lap top and I'm conflicted. I got a compliment that I have beautiful eye balls from this girl that had a picture of Hitler on her lap top and I'm conflicted. @Lindsay_Renee31 Awe 😩😩 I love you linds ❤❤. @Lindsay_Renee31 Dude don't even worry about that!!!. @Lindsay_Renee31 GIRL I WILL ALWAYS TEXT YOU BACK. I have 3/4 of the 2009 pennies and I'm SO EXCITED. Village Inn brought us pies at work and I am SO HAPPY. So I walked into chipotle today and they were like "CAN'T GET ENOUGH CAN YOU??" I have an addiction.. Oh how ruthless I was https://t.co/TJ02A7TUwp. @baileygalyon You're my favorite for saying this. One of these days I'll come home at a decent hour. 😂. *breakroom convo*

I switched to gieco and I saved 21% and yes I did the math.. Thanks twitter ❤ https://t.co/6SMBmDeZSo. Burrito or bowl from chipotle today?!. To my friends dealing with long distance relationships, I promise if it's the right person it's worth it ❤. Honestly love spending time with Zach's family because they constantly roast each other and it's great. Church with this hottie today 😊❤ https://t.co/NcxLj0QH0s. I get to see Zach everyday now and I don't know what to do with myself. In 24 hours I will be with Zach and that's literally all I can think about right now. Can someone explain to me how I left for work 15 minutes late and managed to get there early enough to stop for chick fil a breakfast???. In 2 days Zach will be home for good ❤❤. MY MOM WENT AND GOT ME ONE AND IT WAS DELICIOUS 12/10. I'm hecka craving one of these and I just laid down because I'm exhausted. Is it worth getting up?!??? https://t.co/NeKNnMzyJI. It just makes me feel accomplished and like putting off school for a few years wasn't a mistake.. My favorite thing is when I train new people and they're like wut you're only 20, I wish I was at your place when I was your age. Today I walked into a door because that's how tired I am. Happy Monday folks.. @Lindsay_Renee31 My bank account already says no 😂. I just have to get through this week and Zach will be home on Saturday.. As misleading as this picture is, I am NOT engaged. 😂 love this boy so much ❤ https://t.co/NJW9fsBH9L. On my way to Zach 😊❤. Flight delayed 😑👎. Airport here we come 😊😊.

I can't wait for Zach's birthday, I have the BEST plan 😊😈🎂. @taylor_rogers13 they've been here for a while, normally up by eastlake!! Maybe they're migrating, any who they are very confused turkeys 😂😂. @taylor_rogers13 they were in my backyard traumatizing my dogs a few days ago 😂😂. Honestly as hard as long distance is, it's so rewarding.. There was a loose dog and my manager let us bring it into the bank ❤❤ we now have a work pet until it's owner comes to get it ❤. Ever have those days where you wake up and are already looking forward to going back to bed that night?

Zach is probably the best thing that's ever happened to me and it tears me apart knowing I won't get to see him for another month and half. @TaylorMamuzich I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. MY HEART IS SO HAPPY 😊❤. Find yourself a man that gives you his grilled cheese because his is less burnt than yours.. I would be sick the ONE time I get to see Zach. When you make dinner for your boyfriend and his roommates and they ask you when you're leaving because they want you to cook for them 24/7. What I have with Zach is so different and I'm SO happy. 😌. Zach sings while we drives and it melts my heart ❤. About to go hide in the pantry again because I have to fulfill my title of pantry mistress. The guys at the shop are all super impressed with how good of shape my jeep is in, YEAH BECAUSE I TAKE CARE OF IT DUH. Lol Zach's mom is sending a care package for him with me.

Honestly can't wait to spend  next weekend with Zach, it's exactly what I need. 😊😊. I spent my entire lunch break talking to Zach on the phone, worth it. I have been responding to my boyfriend with fitting memes all day and he's jealous of my quick witted ness. Why am I so tired I just want to go to bed. Do you ever see your dog and want to hug them forever because same. I want to go to bed but instead I'm out in golden trying to win a snowboard.. You have to do what's best for you. All $20 of it.

Today I was going to get a hair cut, do laundry and change the oil on my jeep. Instead I decided to go snowboarding. #adulting. Keeping this a secret is insanely hard man.. Nice, I still have no idea where I should go to school. 😂😂. My dad has added Zach on facebook, instagram and snapchat I can't 😂😂. I feel like I've lost all my friends. @Lindsay_Renee31 thanks❤❤❤. And you know what else? He motivates me more than anything.. The reason I'm going is because I have dreams and goals of having a music school AND ILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. I'm trying to do what's best for ME. Sure he will be up there too, but that's a BONUS, NOT THE REASON IM GOING. Lemme tell you something. I did not choose a school based on where my boyfriend is going.. I'm livid. I'm livid. Do you seriously think that I haven't learned from my past, I am who I am now because of all the things I've made it through.. Honestly though, I love swing dancing and I can't wait to get super good.. On our first date Zach asked me to dance in my living room and that was my favorite thing ever.. Zach and I sync watch HIMYM together and it's probably my favorite thing. 😌. Just gotta take it one day at a time. I already want 14 more tacos. Already feel like crap so why not add to it with taco bell am I right?. I've honestly never had such strong feelings for someone before and it's the best feeling ever. I USUALLY GET CHIPOTLE EVERY MONDAY AND I DIDN'T TODAY 😭. One more month till I get to see Zach and I'm so beyond excited. 😊😊. @Hayley_B3 YOOOO SAME. hey I'll likely be coming through Utah on presidents day, maybe I'll stop by and see you!. My nephew dabs everytime he sneezes I CANT HANDLE THIS. 😂😂. @Lindsay_Renee31 chipotle!!!!!. Being separated from the one you want to be with most is probably the hardest thing. This is exactly why I don't give you advice because you turn around and do the exact same thing and never learn. Why are people in such a rush to grow up, take your time, enjoy the small things, it's not a race. I was thinking about going for a run tonight but screw that it's cold, I'll just order a pizza instead. @K_Rod1996 bruhhh I'm dying over here. Why is this month going by so slow. Even though I'm all moved out and on my own I still can't make my own choices 😂. Do you not realize that I'm not going to be able to attend every single family event, I have my own life. what the HECK, my boyfriend is the best. I'm so blessed.. god works in mysterious ways and I love it and him.. Guess what just happened!!!! I'M A MESS. https://t.co/CjKPIYreFX. Do you ever just wanna drop all your responsibilities and run away for a while because that's me right now. @yenmaster87 same I'd be down!. The closest chipotle to my boyfriend is 70 miles away and I told him I'd eat more chipotle to make up for all that he isn't eating. 😂. The biggest lesson I've learned is you have to learn to be happy alone before you can let someone else into your life.. Please please please PLEASE never drive drunk. It was a beautiful day up at Winter Park today ❤😊🏂 https://t.co/cWzPKt53zv. I am so lucky to finally have a guy that will put effort into our relationship 😊😊. It took 2 days. I was finally able to enter my car normally today. THANK GOODNESS. The right person will make the wrong time right. https://t.co/09swdNaFon. @Lindsay_Renee31 hit me up!!. @Lindsay_Renee31 still here baby boo. I wonder how many days it will be before I don't have to enter my car from the passenger door beCAUSE MY DOOR IS FROZEN SHUT. I hope this next month goes by real quick.  😂😭. Loyalty is not watching ahead. @Lindsay_Renee31 nothing to worry about I just want a break from responsibility 😂. Mac and cheese is true love. i feel a solid breakdown coming soon. lovely.. When everyone and their mom was at chipotle today what the heck. I love you too Lindsay!! ❤❤ https://t.co/5BFIXCR1bc. Aaaaand my friends are gone https://t.co/cQBsE7wOUC. It's only 600 miles. @Lindsay_Renee31 I'm here bb. When see you tomorrow turns into I don't know when I'll see you next. @Lindsay_Renee31 @mattjames______ DUDE I KNOW. @Lindsay_Renee31 @mattjames______ YESSSSSSS I AM SO EXCITED ALREADY. @Lindsay_Renee31 do you and Matt want to get chipotle tomorrow. @Lindsay_Renee31 same though 😂😂. My new year's kiss was perfect. Except he's leaving in less than 36 hours.. I said I'd never do long distance again and here I am. But oddly enough I'm okay with it and couldn't be happier. 😊. You make me a better version of me. @Lindsay_Renee31 well you see maybe we just can't be because I'm starting to feel the need to pee. Friend: happy birthday!
Me: thanks you too.. 😐 wait

Everytime. @Lindsay_Renee31 what the heck that was so cute I might cry and get a stye in my eye. @Lindsay_Renee31 it's okay when you fail put it in a pail. Thanks rhyme buddy! ❤ https://t.co/NXTKuymURC. What a great birthday gift from mother nature. I'm just going to eat like crap these next few days and continue that trend into the new year so I can have insulation and be squishy.. A guy that actually wants to meet my family?!? What is this sorcery?. @mattjames______ I was waiting for someone to point that out. My excuse is that I'm lazy.. Merry Christmas. 😊 https://t.co/vEW3ajTB2q. @Lindsay_Renee31 thanks!!!!! 😊😊. He kinda sorta lights up my world. 😊 https://t.co/HnvbKgU0Yn. This literally happened though. *is going on date*

Hey I'm gonna be late lol https://t.co/doGejBKsF1. Have I met the perfect man?

Makes bad puns with me, amazing at the piano, snowboards, encourages me and so much more.. Remember when I said I'd stop staying out late. I got home at 4:30 again last night lol. I'm going to die.. These last 2 weeks have been some of the best in my whole life.. @kayl0kay thanks ❤. I only got ready because I'm playing my viola in a wedding tonight tbh https://t.co/8Lrxn3OAEU. I'm playing music for a friend's wedding today and I can't help but be excited for my own

O wait haha

Hah

Hah

Like that will ever happen. Do I have a fever or am I just really hot? 😏😉. I'm extremely bitter about this. I would get sick right before the Christmas program that I'm singing and playing like EVERYTHING IN. Also I need to stop coming home at 4 every night.. You know what I need? A booty massage.. When the guys plan the date: rogue one
When the girls plan the date: zoo lights

I'm gonna be sad when my crew leaves in 2 weeks.. I have to be up in 3 hours. 😊. I get to see rogue one with a really cool guy tomorrow and I'm very excited 😊. @reno_lexi love you❤. lol I really don't know what's gonna happen here. @JustGotaBeliev3 hi josh. Me: he's leaving in a few weeks, don't catch feelings

crap.. @martin_yoselin I'm super anti tinder now, nothing good ever came out of it 😂. @martin_yoselin seriously the worst, I just wanted to enjoy my steak and he came and tried to make conversation. @martin_yoselin that happened to me at Texas Roadhouse 😂. I literally don't even know how to act because I can't remember the last time a guy made me his priority. When you have a nice lil group to go on double dates and they ALL LEAVE FOR SCHOOL IN 3 WEEKS FML. I'm so used to getting ignored that I don't know what to do with all this attention I'm receiving.. Me: I'm not going to open up because I always end up getting hurt.
Also me: I'll just do it anyways and pretend I don't have feelings.. Thanks for letting your true colors shine. *casually gets home at 5am*. Thanks life for bringing awesome people into my life only for them to leave in a few weeks. 

What a great joke. My life just turned into a hallmark movie. WHAT THE EVEN HECK. lead by example. Paying extra for covered parking was so worth it, guess who didn't have to scrape off their car this morning 😁. I got food and my mood has completely changed.. My manager called me out for being hangry and he was soooooo right. So many mixed emotions right now. Laura Laura LAURA what are you doing?!?. @yenmaster87 and then you went to go pick it up to tweet about it?? 😂. When you actually say what's on your mind and you have probably ruined everything https://t.co/eK0gUVVD2d. A year later and it's still pertinent. Wow! https://t.co/NbmbCmwVEX. I hate how glued I am to my phone, I think it's time to change that.. Kinda stressed but also I GOT THIS. How to win me over:

Cute pictures of dogs
Puns
Food. Sarah thinks that every guy falls in love with me but that is SO NOT TRUE 😂😂. I'm surrounded by a bunch of friends that surpass my pun creating levels and it's very unsettling but also comforting.. Maybe I don't need a relationship either. Came into work today and my boss was like "hey you don't look so dead for once!!!!"

thanks. candles are lit, Christmas lights are on, fuzzy socks, Christmas movie and hot cocoa. What a perfect evening to myself. 😊. Love love LOVE being in public wearing headphones, makes me feel like I'm in a movie.. I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THIS https://t.co/MqmILjQTTX. Made it through airport security with a ton of the mints from Olive Garden 😂😂. Just asked my parents if they got any in their room, and they didn't. I'm getting special treatment or being stalked! Nice!. Last night when I got to my room the was a little Andes mint that was left on the counter and I impulsively ate it. @Lindsay_Renee31 who would pay to watch me awkwardly flirt and make an abundance of terrible puns?. "THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE CUTE.". So he brought our food out and my plate had significantly larger bacon on it than my moms and she just gave me this look. Ordering from guy, who is is INSANELY CUTE

Him: did you want anything else like bacon or potatoes?
Me: BACON PLEASE
Him: I thought so 😏. At breakfast

Dad: go hookup with that guy and order
Mom: no do not hookup with him, just order. story time with fam

me: ...and it wreaked of weed
cousin: wait so there was seaweed all over the floor??

so innocent. 😩. When you're on vacation and you were enjoying yourself and then get all these texts about the Christmas program and the stress returns 😐. @reno_lexi the bag is still there?!? 😂😂😂. I honestly can't wait until the day where I meet a guy that I can bring home for the holidays.. Shooting is fun but my arms are real dead. @Lindsay_Renee31 same man I literally work all the time. I don't know what 'free' time is. @Lindsay_Renee31 I LOVE making things awkward!!! I don't even know my schedule for next week. 😂😂. @Lindsay_Renee31 I would only go back to high school to know what the heck we were doing here 😂😂 chipotle soon???. Quotes from Thanksgiving:

I don't twerk for cookies.. When the family starts asking about your dating life, you guys NOT EVEN I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. *starves self all day so I can take in the maximum amount of food possible*. I smuggled cookies onto the plane lol. 9. People will leave and sometimes you just have to let them.. 8. Take time out of your day and learn something new, even if it's something as simple as learning to fold a fitted sheet.. 7. Take risks. You don't learn anything from the comfort zone.. 6. Don't buy into lies, it's so unhealthy.. 5. Never lower your standards for ANYONE.. 4. Be yourself no matter what.. 3. Don't judge people, because you never know what they're going through/have been through.. 2. Don't let another person be the sole reason for your happiness. Be happy alone.. The biggest lessons I've learned this year:

1. Don't wait around for anyone, it's not worth your time.. What a start to the day! Decided to make myself a 5 star breakfast and I set off the smoke alarm!

!!!!!. I would finally get motivation and time to actually put my room together at 10:30 at night. Realizing I'll be in AZ and can't wear sweaters there. Dang it.. Day 1 of vacation: binged on Star Wars, ate chipotle, went shopping, decorated for Christmas

solid. I am so thankful for the friends I've made since I moved here. YAY NOW I CAN DO NOTHING FOR A WHOLE WEEK I'M SO EXCITED.. 50 more minutes and I am officially on VACATION. I snoozed through all 4 of my alarms this morning 😂😂😂. My parents understand memes, what the heck. I'm finally at the point where I can enjoy myself and not have any expectations. 😊. Pumpkin cookies are my FAVE. Thinking about how I don't have work for a WHOLE WEEK and I want to cry out of pure happiness. Holla at free games with great seats. My coworker is engaged to a manager of the Rockies. HOW COOL.. In a quick 24 hours I'm about to be the happiest girl. 😌. I'm literally getting paid to watch snow fall right now ❄. Snow SNOW SNOW SNOW SNOW. 😀. I LOVE PASTA SO MUCH. @Lindsay_Renee31 @mattjames______ miss you too😢❤. Highlight of my night was @mattjames______  and @Lindsay_Renee31 calling me. SO GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICES. 😩. One more week till in n out. Have you ever lost balance while squatting down to grab something and you totally just fall right in front of your boss??

Same. Things I'm great at: over reacting. @NearMissLyss AWE ❤ bless your heart, you're too sweet!!. @Hayley_B3 Thanks Hayley. 😊. Maybe I'm just damaged goods, because this happens every single time.. Man I can't wait for my hair to grow back out. Man I can't wait for my hair to grow back out. Thanks to my bishopric everyone now thinks I'm thirsty as heck and want a relationship!!!!! GREAT!. 😬. I'm so stressed about not being good enough for this Christmas program that I had NIGHTMARES ALL NIGHT ABOUT CONDUCTING UGH. *talking about school with a few friends*

Me: the only kind of loan I have is being ALONE. 

Haha. I climbed over a fence and my jeans got stuck and my friends had to get me unstuck 😂😭😂. What a great day, I needed this. 😊. Maintaining a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ mindset through this is real tough. On the bright side I'm 7 months tinder free!!. Always get my hopes up and then my dreams are crushed 

lol I'm okay though. If this doesn't say 'fall' then IDK what does https://t.co/dNZKL8lnGL. I'm a weak potato. This guy is moving to Wisconsin to be a cheese scientist, I thought he was joking but HES DEAD SERIOUS. This is my tenth straight day in a row working, AND I HAVE THE DAY OFF TOMORROW BUT GET HOLIDAY PAY. PRAISE. My original plan was a promotion within a year and I'm literally on my 4th month there.. Told my manager that I'm interested in moving up and she agreed. 😊 Things are looking real good.. I get more compliments on my nails from guys than o do girls... why?!???. I look at where I was a year ago and just laugh at myself and realize I'm in the same situation again lol. My eyebrows looked GREAT today and that's all that matters. Drowning my sorrows with pizza tonight. My brother was asking me about the guy I like while I was ordering pizza and I was just like all I care about right now is my pizza. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I cannot stand noisy eaters. Me: Gets nails done totally knowing that I'm working on my jeep tomorrow. Lol nice. Also you saw me yesterday dingus @SarahMeyer215. I am dead. https://t.co/Ctnhfq7Hm6. What the heck happened tonight 😂😂😂. I've just come to the acceptance that I'll be sleep deprived until Friday..

Guy at the car wash saw my board in the car and was like "ay let's go ride" how dude. I don't even know your name or if you have a dog. Someone left snow on our porch then ding ding ditched us, wow you really got us!!. If you truly cared you would find a way to be there for me and not give me excuses. "You need to worry about how good the star wars movie was not worry about some drunk girl". You're officially an adult when you go out to lunch with your dad and you pay. @Lindsay_Renee31 this actually happened that's the worst part 😂😂😂. Aadyn: I'm eating pears.
Tanischa: We have pears?
Me: APEARantly
*everyone laughs*
Aaliyah: That's not funny.

same. Goes to guys house, cuddles with his dog instead. Lol. Tamales are great any time of the day 😋. I hate myself for all the stupid puns I make. Moving out in a month and the extent of my packing is I bought boxes.. I'm so beyond glad I met you 😊. Please learn to spell before you dumb hoes put things like this on the internet https://t.co/d91HAiHW0v. I cancelled all my plans for today and ordered a bunch of Chinese food bc I feel like crap. You also know you had too many energy drinks when you cant get a complete logical sentence out, everyone probably thought I was on drugs lol. I had too many energy drinks and I can't see anything straight. It's almost that time again. https://t.co/F1KMLPimMy. My dog touched the butt. The renters are blasting red solo cup omg. Don't understand how I get so lucky like this 😂😭😂. What a great night 😊. I'M NOT NERVOUS WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. I've done a lot of things I said I never would but I honestly don't have a problem with that bc then I wouldn't be the same person I am now. Just gotta keep reminding myself that I get off work at 1:45 and I'll be able to go home and watch Netflix until 5 am tomorrow. I get so uncomfortable when men wink at me. Staaahp. Realizing this is my last Christmas that I'll be living at home woah. My life actually just turned into a hallmark/lifetime holiday movie. The best feeling is when you realize you've moved on. 😊. Not joking around about this whole jeep thing. Hopefully buying one tomorrow 😁. If I go to the HHS winter concert tomorrow will someone go with me so I'm not lonely. Lol the guy just decided to keep the jeep and give it to his son instead. Fml 😊. I'm about to cry bc they didn't sell the jeep before I got here 😭😭😭😂😵😍. How much weed did you smoke?

It's seaweed it's ok.. Desperate for a jeep. Sometimes you just gotta put yourself out there. There were like ten puppies in the store at once and I lost my cool. TOO MANY CUTE.. Won two free a basin lift tickets HECK YEAH. Not So Silent Night is gonna be lit. December is my favorite month because of all the cute fun things to do. 😊. I don't even drink bruh. When you get offered alcohol at the baby shower omg 😂😂. *needs to start packing but buys more new things instead*. I got home from work at 7:30 this morning and just woke up and I'm craving fried chicken like no other.. I got home from work at 7:30 this morning and just woke up and I'm craving fried chicken like no other.. Overnight shifts are cool there's no one in the store this is great. I guess you could say I pet the crap out of it.. LIKE TWICE IN 24 HOURS RIGHT BEFORE I GO TO LOOK AT THE JEEP THEY ARE LIKE SORRY IT SOLD. Fml. I'm having the worst luck getting a jeep.. Okay if this jeep gets sold right before I go look at it too I will probably kill someone. Today I've pet 4 dogs, one of which shit all over a kid. My weeks total is 9/50 million.. I don't know if this was my fault or not. I was petting a dog and it lost bowel control and spewed shit all over a kid, I had to walk away I was laughing so hard.. I'm a fan of the RMSP and RMSP+ passes. If you're a fan too, use this link to enter the Powder in Numbers Contest! https://t.co/TEmBMJ1Bsk. I had a coworker tell me that I have a cute butt, not sure if I should be flattered or creeped out.. Like I'm moving out in a month I really should get on that. I really need to start packing my stuff. My niece: I have a rash.
Me: Stop being irRASHional.. Today I pet 5 dogs. 😊 Only 50 million more to go.. My life goal is to pet all the dogs in the whole world. I'm so into you and you are oblivious of it 😊🔫. My coworker: "We should rap Christmas music. Oh yeah Santa's coming to town and he's gonna smack that hoe hoe hoe.". I saw a spider on my arm and I literally jumped across the room and hid behind my dogs.. If this guy doesn't get back to me soon about the jeep I will cry. Did someone say jeep? 😉. This guy just came into panda with one girl left, and came back with a different girl. #savage. @bsimmonsjr @josieatk don't you mean throw 'hams'. Hopefully mashed potatoes will fix my feelings. Turns out I'm not as tough as I had thought and I just broke.. I left my wallet in the car so I wouldn't buy him. That's what I call self control. https://t.co/qxhcMrDBAW. I regret how much mac &amp; cheese I just made. Nicole: I have to plan what to wear for Thanksgiving.
Me: lol I'm wearing sweats so I won't have to unbuckle my jeans when I'm full. All my friends are totally getting paintings of dogs for Christmas.. @thomasjphelps if you stay in the Denver metro area you guys can hitch a ride to Aspen w/me. I am more excited than I should be about my snowboarding helmet because IT HAS BUILT IN HEADPHONES. Miracles happen and the saga continues, I didn't have the nerve to get his number YET AGAIN.. I kinda wish you'd text me just to know that I didn't completely mess up our friendship.. Not yet at least https://t.co/Wc2vfmPzHC. @K_Rod1996 @Mariniciaaaaaa I would like to emphasize crocs that would be a great gift. Adulting is hard.. But I guess that means I have an entire weekend to snowboard 🏂. I took a 4 day weekend  off work just for a trip that might not even happen lolololol. Pretty sure I just saw a dog driving but who knows. So I painted this dog, it isn't great but it resembles a dog and that's all that matters. Dogs are all that matter. https://t.co/EIvwBU2qvb. What a relief to know that Brooklyn is safe and will be home from her Europe trip tomorrow. 😌. Should have got your number the other night bc the chance that I'll see you again is sitting at a solid 36%. @mattjames______ @Mariniciaaaaaa @Acapellavids I HATED it. I use bad pick up lines and they work. https://t.co/iPCtB0lEyJ. This is why dogs are my favorite, they work miracles.. So I watched a baby tonight &amp; he wouldn't stop crying so I thought "when I'm sad I look at pics of dogs" so I showed him some AND HE STOPPED. I teach a viola lesson in ten mins and I really don't want to leave my bed 😭. Empty promises everywhere. I HAVE THE BEST FRIENDS ❤ https://t.co/ylfORMVSYO. I just wanna go on my roadtrip to Idaho already. Why was I so stupid?! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Shoulda left it where it was but there's no going back now. 😂. I can't stop thinking about pumpkin pie. Halloweenies. 🎃 https://t.co/UycQPyZ0Tc. Also there was a guy that looks just like Brendon Urie. The panda costume is a man magnet. 😏. I hit it off with a lumberjack until he found out I was 18 😢. Do you wanna know what I'm wearing under my panda costume? 😉😏

Another panda costume.. I've been hit on more than ever wearing a panda suit, I don't understand, I'm basically wearing pajamas.. Just realized you guys are lds and now you're even more of an inspiration to me. 😊 @kenzienimmo @HarrisCHeller https://t.co/RPeYWsQb35. @TaylorMamuzich you're my favorite pit buddy too ❤😘. Berklee won't stop bugging me maybe I should apply just for the hell of it. Lol JK I'm not good enough for that school.. Honestly surprised my neck isn't broken after tonight's pits. The Story So Far was rad✌. It's probably a good thing I didn't go to CSU because there's too many attractive guys HOLY HOT. I'm too punny for my own good. https://t.co/CqJlYA5j74. @ChloeMares music started way bach when. "It was the instance our fingers touched that I knew it wasn't friendship, it was love." TED MOSBY, IF ONLY IT WAS THAT EASY. @KessRyan works everytime 😏😂. *actual encounter of me flirting*
Guy: Why don't you have a boyfriend?
Me: I murdered him. 

WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME. 😂😭😂😭😂. This makes me cry everytime and I'm not sure if it's bc it's 2 am or I'm just sappy.  https://t.co/U6tHK3MhnW. Real talk, why is it called chili if it's hot.. @princesslynds15 the body part of course. I do think baby cows are really cute though. I have an obsession with calves.. Taking a year off before college was the best choice I've ever made.. I freaking love dogs so much. Chicken nuggets @Mariniciaaaaaa @mattjames______. @taylor_rogers13 because I kinda was speeding a lot. LOL I need to be a more responsible jammer. @taylor_rogers13 I ALMOST DID. The cop and I were just making jokes the whole time.. @taylor_rogers13 I may or may not have been jamming too hard and might not have paid attention to my speed. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. "Sorry officer my window is broken lol". Might as well add another TØP show into the wild assortment of concerts I'm attending over the next 2 months. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
